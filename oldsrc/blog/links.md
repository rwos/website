Just some links I stumbled upon recently:

The first one's an interview with Ken Arnold, and also the best discussion
about program design and OOP I've ever read. It's actually the only discussion
of OOP I know of that doesn't revolve around solutions for self-inflicted
problems.

I couldn't find a page with the whole text, so here's
[part 1](http://www.artima.com/intv/perfectP.html),
[part 2](http://www.artima.com/intv/tasteP.html),
[part 3](http://www.artima.com/intv/distribP.html),
[part 4](http://www.artima.com/intv/swayP.html),
[part 5](http://www.artima.com/intv/decoupleP.html),
and [part 6](http://www.artima.com/intv/issuesP.html).

The NSA recently declassified their internal magazine "Cryptologs". Quite a lot
of the content is still blacked-out, though. Also, this is pretty much the
worst magazine I've ever read. The whole thing looks extremely amateur.
Still, quite interesting, I think.

The PDFs are available on [the NSA website](http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/cryptologs.shtml)
and there's also a [Cryptome mirror](http://cryptome.org/2013/03/cryptologs/nsa-cryptologs-contents-01.htm).

Last but not least, here's a short and simple tutorial for [cloth and ragdoll simulations
using verlet integration](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/simulate-fabric-and-ragdolls-with-simple-verlet-integration/).

Not very useful if you're not currently working on a game - but what kind of programmer
isn't always working on some kind of a game? There, you see, useful for everyone.
