Certainly Not Mainstream
2013-04-24

I like reading source code but it's hard to find suggestions for programs that
make a good read. There are some lists floating around the web, but it's always
the same four or five projects - sqlite, xmonad, and so on. And it seemed to
me that most people blurting out "sqlite" didn't really *read* it.

Well, I thought, one way to get informed suggestions for programs
to read would be to create a community of people who read programs.

So I created [/r/listing](http://reddit.com/r/listing), and announced
it on [/r/programming](http://reddit.com/r/programming), and...

...it bombed. Completely. 5 upvotes, 5 downvotes. I knew that it wouldn't
exactly attract millions of people, but I also didn't expect it to do *that*
bad.

But it's not the end of the world. We do have 6 subscribers, mind you. It will
be a slower growth than I anticipated but maybe that's actually a good thing.

The current suggestions for programs to read are:

* [st - a simple X11 terminal emulator](http://git.suckless.org/st/tree/) (I posted that)
* [lua - the programming language interpreter](http://www.lua.org/source/5.2/) (I posted that one, too)

aaaaaand - \*drum roll\*

[xmonad](http://code.haskell.org/xmonad/).

Well, what can I say - it's a start.
