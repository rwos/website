I've been playing with typography a bit lately. It's a surprisingly
addictive way to waste time.

I've read Robert Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style" and I rather
liked it. The problem is, of course, once I've read it I couldn't stop thinking
about typography.

I know that I do a lot of things very wrong on this website - I use the wrong
symbols for quotes, apostrophes, and dashes. I probably use the wrong fonts
on the wrong places. That, and a million of other small details.

I don't necessarily want *perfect* typography - but I've started to try
and correct at least the most glaring errors (I know, I know, some might say
that the biggest error is using green font on a green background - I obviously
disagree about *that* one). I do like Futura, so I've changed the headlines to
something vaguely like it (There aren't that many free geometric fonts to
choose from). I've also played a bit with the margins and line-heights and that
sort of thing.

The result is nowhere near perfect but I do think it's better than what things
looked like before.

One great way to waste even more time is to design a font face. I obviously
lack the expertise to do that properly - but that has never stopped me and
it won't now.

There quite a lot of open source font creation tools around - I've tried
using [FontForge](http://fontforge.org/), a graphical outline editor, but the
version that ships with Debian doesn't seem to play very well with the
tiling window manager I use. It's also a quite powerful tool - too
powerful for beginners like me.

I have then briefly looked at [METAFONT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont),
Donald Knuth's font programming language. But while the concept is quite nice
and easy things are surprisingly easy to achieve, the whole system is much too
involved for my needs.

I don't want to become a font designer, I just want to play around with a few
parameters.

And, as luck would have it, I've just found a tool that does exactly that:

[metaflop](http://www.metaflop.com/modulator), a web-based graphical user
interface for METAFONT. Including webfont export.

I've only found that thing an hour ago and I can't stop playing with it. It's
really well made, and you don't have to know anything about fonts to
use it. It's a lot of fun.

Well, only if you use the same strange definition of "fun" as I do, of course.
