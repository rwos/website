This hack is written in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.

Source code is here: <a href="{{ page.url }}.pde">{{ page.url }}.pde</a>.

It's running below via processingjs, which unfortunately doesn't work 100%.

<script src="/3rd/processing.min.js"></script>
<canvas data-processing-sources="{{ page.url }}.pde"></canvas>
