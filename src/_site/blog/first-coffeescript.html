This is mostly about the syntax - but then again, CoffeeScript <em>is</em> mostly about the syntax.</p><p>I like it, overall, it’s definitely a step up from JavaScript. Though it is a bit of a “works 90% of the time” design: it quickly gets unintuitive once you come to the corner-cases. There’s a bit too much implicit stuff in the syntax for my taste - but it’s certainly pretty clean and noise-free (at least in simple cases).</p><p>Nice features include:</p><p>Function application chains can be written without parentheses:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo a         # like foo(a)
foo a b c d   # like foo(a(b(c(d))))
foo a b,c,d   # like foo(a(b, c, d))
</code></pre></div></div><p>So it basically gives you an automatic <code class="highlighter-rouge">compose</code> - it doesn’t, however, do an automatic <code class="highlighter-rouge">curry</code>:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo = (a, b) -&gt; a+b   # like foo = function(a, b) {return a+b;}
foo a                 # could/should return "(b) -&gt; a+b" but doesn't
</code></pre></div></div><p>Also, combined with some of the other expression-oriented syntax (especially list-comprehensions) one can basically write arbitrarily confusing constructs:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo  x  for x in [1, 2, 3]   # like foo(1); foo(2); foo(3);
foo (x) for x in [1, 2, 3]   # same as above
foo (x  for x in [1, 2, 3])  # like foo([1, 2, 3])
</code></pre></div></div><p>My first comment isn’t quite the whole truth - the whole first line is also an expression and that expression evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">[1, 2, 3]</code>:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bar(foo x for x in [1, 2, 3])
# behaves like foo(1); foo(2); foo(3); bar([1, 2, 3])
</code></pre></div></div><p>Let’s try and refactor that:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>result = foo x for x in [1, 2, 3]
bar(result)
# behaves like foo(1); foo(2); foo(3); bar(3) -- whoopsy!
</code></pre></div></div><p>Well, that’s the price one has to pay for the extreme terseness.</p><h2 id="splats-1">splats 1</h2><p>Then, there’s a feature they call “splats”. Which is a stupid name, but that’s because “splats” are actually three distinct features and the name basically refers to the lexical token “…” and not to a semantic concept.</p><p>The first “…” usage is for rest-args in function definitions:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo = (a, b...) -&gt; # b is a list

# equivalent Scheme code:
# (define (foo a . b) (#| b is a list |#))
</code></pre></div></div><p>What is nice, is that (unlike in Scheme) this works not only for the last parameters, but everywhere (where it makes sense):</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo = (a..., b) -&gt; # a contains all but the last parameter
</code></pre></div></div><h2 id="splats-2">splats 2</h2><p>Feature number two is splicing arguments in function calls (basically syntactic sugar for apply):</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>list = [1, 2, 3]
print list       # like print([1, 2, 3])
print list...    # like print.apply(null, [1, 2, 3])
</code></pre></div></div><p>Splicing literals and expressions works, too. And you can combine spliced arguments with non-spliced ones - though <em>not</em> on the REPL (at least in 1.6.3), since it’s broken. And the last activity on <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2906">a related bug</a> is “reopened 2 months ago”.</p><p>That doesn’t quite fill me with enthusiasm for CoffeeScript, I have to say… (The REPL is also a bit cumbersome to use - one has to manually switch into multi-line mode in order to enter line breaks.)</p><p>Some other corner-cases also work (even on the REPL, yay!):</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>foo = -&gt; [1, 2] # (function w/o arguments)
do foo          # (call that function, returns [1, 2])

print do foo    # like print([1, 2])
print do foo... # like print(1, 2)
</code></pre></div></div><h2 id="splats-3">splats 3</h2><p>The third “splats” usage is in “destructing assignment” from lists and objects:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[head, stuff..., tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# stuff will be [2, 3, 4]
# (except on the REPL, where it will fail)
</code></pre></div></div><p>That’s really nice, but why they use brackets on the left side of the assignment is beyond me. PHP does something semantically similar (<code class="highlighter-rouge">list(a, b, c) = array(1, 2, 3)</code>) - but that’s wrong, people! The whole <em>point</em> about the left side of such an assignment is that it is <em>not</em> a list.</p><h2 id="cobol">COBOL</h2><p>CoffeeScript also has that whole Perl-like reverse-if stuff:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = "foo" if y == "bar"
</code></pre></div></div><strike>Python has that too</strike><p><small>(Whoops, no, I was misremembering here: Python only has the “<code class="highlighter-rouge">x = can_fail() or default_value</code>” idiom)</small> - and Python also loves code that reads like simplified English sentences. But CoffeeScript is in a whole other league:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while player isnt dead
    if key is space then jump quickly upwards unless status is jumping
</code></pre></div></div><p>Given a bunch of trivial definitions, this is absolutely valid CoffeeScript code. I don’t know if they want to win over the COBOL crowd with this nonsense, or what is going on here. I just know I don’t like it. (One doesn’t <em>have to</em> write in that pseudo-readable style, of course - though the tutorial does make it clear that this is the preferred way to do things).</p><p>As I see it, this is basically the underlying theme of CoffeeScript: syntactic cuteness.</p><p>There is a syntax for array slices, in which two dots denote an inclusive end, and three dots denote an exclusive end - cute, yes, but also a new record for the least amount of pixels that are wrong per off-by-one error.</p><p>Also, consider:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls = [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[0..3]                    # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[..]                      # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[0...3]                   # is [0, 1, 2]
ls[...]                     # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[0....3]                  # is []
ls[0.....3]                 # is a parse error
ls[0....999999999999999999] # is [0]
ls[0...999999999999999999]  # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[0..999999999999999999]   # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[0.999999999999999999]    # is 1

# bonus:
ls[..-&gt;]    # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[...-&gt;]   # is []
ls[.."3"]   # is [0, 1, 2, 3]
ls[..."3"]  # is [0, 1, 2]
ls[.."x"]   # is [0, 1, 2 ,3]
ls[..."x"]  # is []
</code></pre></div></div><p>Unlikely that a programmer would write one of the stranger examples, but if CoffeeScript had macros, or a preprocessor, it would be quite difficult to use. But it doesn’t. It just has cute syntax.</p><p>There’s another “cute” thing, <code class="highlighter-rouge">?=</code>, which sets a variable to a value when the variable is undefined or null:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = null
x ?= 3 # if x is null or undefined, set it to 3
</code></pre></div></div><p>But you have to declare the variable first, which kind of defeats the whole point. If you don’t want to do that, you can use the following instead:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = x ? 3    # set x to 3 if x doesn't exist
</code></pre></div></div><p>But pay attention to not write it as</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = x? 3
</code></pre></div></div><p>Because that always sets x to <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code>. (No, I don’t know why.)</p><p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code> also has an accessor variant, as in:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>object?.key
</code></pre></div></div><p>Which returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> if <code class="highlighter-rouge">key</code> doesn’t exist in <code class="highlighter-rouge">object</code>. So that’s nice, especially for longer chains (on the other hand - longer chains of objects returning objects aren’t exactly good code to begin with).</p><p>Which brings us to the whole hash-table/object stuff, but that’s stuff for another post.</p><p>Happy Hacking!</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/wmii-color-status">Colored Text in wmii's Status Bar</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/second-coffeescript">CoffeeScript - Second Impressions</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/gherkin">Given When Then</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
