It describes the joys of having a Forever Project, a project that can’t be completed but that you also can’t stop to think about.</p><p>Needless to say, I quite liked it. I used to think that I was just not productive enough, not working hard enough on those kinds of projects. The post promotes a quite different, more romantic view: How wonderful, all those people working on crazy, ambitious, world-changing stuff!</p><p>However, the post says “a” forever project, as in “one” - and I have more than one that would fit the description. So I still think I’m slacking too much. The truth is probably somewhere in-between.</p><p>My current Forever Project (see? that doesn’t sound right - you’re supposed to have only one) is a GUI, as in “desktop environment”. I don’t have anything to show, yet. But I thought I might just join in with all the programmers that talked about their crazy/stupid Forever Projects and - well - talk about it.</p><p>Today, I’ll start with a rough outline of my goals:</p><p>I’d like to do some things that are hard or impossible to do in current desktop environments. Some examples:</p><ul><li><p>I’d like to replace the SSL certificate-handling unit in my browser with one that warns me when the certificate changes.</p></li><li><p>I’d like vim (not “something vaguely vim-like”) in every text input field, including the search box of my media player.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a proximity-based mouse cursor, with clicks always going to the nearest button.</p></li><li><p>I’d like to take an HTML renderer and send the output through an edge-detection filter and down-scale the resulting image. On a machine without a display. Why? Well, why not?</p></li><li><p>I’d like to quickly hack one-off shell-scripts with a GUI. And combine them to bigger programs, and into a bigger GUI.</p></li></ul><p>What that really means is that I want the convenience and flexibility that unix provides for text-only programming - only that I want it for GUI programs.</p><p>That also means that:</p><ul><li>Everything has to be completely language-agnostic. Not a framework, nor a library. X11 is already like that, in a way - but it’s too complicated to use.</li><li>Everything should be dead-simple. You should be able to write shell one-liners for simple GUI programs, just as easy as working with text(-files) is on unix today (and was 30 years ago, for that matter…). Printing to a window should not be harder than <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo(1)</code>ing something to a file.</li></ul><p>It’s getting a bit late now, so let’s open another forever project: write a blog post about the forever project. ;-)</p><p>I <em>do</em> have a bit of code already “done”, and I think I have solutions to some of the problems that come up. I’ll be talking about that in the next post. Which, I hope, will not be as abstract/boring as this one…</p><p>Happy Hacking Forever!</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/wrong-repo">You've picked the wrong repository</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/forever-gui-2">A Graphical Forever Project, Part 2</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/forever-gui">A Graphical Forever Project</a>, <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, and <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
