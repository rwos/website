Then another XOR on the same position would “delete” that. After that I would XOR the Bitmap again, on a new position. Which - tada - results in an animated sequence.</p><p>Problem is: SDL doesn’t have any “XOR this with that” primitive. Or I just can’t find it. And - at least this is what Google spits out on the topic - it’s apparently okay to do a whole screen erase and redraw for every single frame.</p><p>Seems a bit resource-wasting to me, but I’ll try that and see how it works out. It sure would simplify some things. And I can imagine modern machines to be fast enough to do this at 40 frames per second. Still, I’m a bit worried whether the 400Mhz MIPS CPU in the NanoNote can handle it.</p><p>Well, there’s my old problem again: too much thinking, too little coding. I just cannot stand bad solutions - not in my own code, at least.</p><p>Gotta work on that, when I think about it…</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/more-cowbell">More Cowbell!</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/the-joy-of-debugging">The Joy Of Debugging</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/test-driven">Test Driven Development</a>, and <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
