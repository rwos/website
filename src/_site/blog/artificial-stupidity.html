So, I thought, I’d dive into some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming">genetic programming</a> (not to be confused with generic programming, the time-wasting technique from OOP-land).</p><p>Genetic programming basically means that you create some random programs and see how well they perform a certain task. Then you pick the best performers, mutate and cross-breed them and test this new generation again. Repeat a few times until some fitness threshold is reached and spit out the best program.</p><p>Sounds like a perfect natural approach to me. In fact it <em>is</em> <em>the</em> perfect natural approach - a thing called <em>evolution</em>.</p><p>Now, the hard points are basically these three:</p><ul><li>how to mutate and cross-breed programs</li><li>how to measure the fitness of programs</li><li>what to choose as the threshold</li></ul><p>Mostly, some kind of Lisp is used as the underlying programming language - but that’s boring, right?</p><p>So I chose Brainfuck.</p><p>I mean what do you take to implement a brain in? Of course, <em>a language that has the word “brain” right in its name</em>. Easy choice. Besides, it enabled me to skip all three problems - and so I hacked together some program that spits out random Brainfuck (bf) programs. Mutation was done through randomly replacing and inserting one of bf’s operators. Cross-breeding was not done at all.</p><p>Next, I opted for binary fitness evaluation - right or wrong. Which, quite elegantly, made choosing a threshold very easy…</p><p>As an input I presented the program (hereafter called by its given name “Stupy”) with a question and an answer. Stupy now tried to rearange his Brainfuck brain until it could produced exactly the given answer, when given the question as an input.</p><p>Now that alone does not make intelligence - so Stupy recorded all question-answer pairs and tested them all. A brain was only held as “working” when all known questions produced the right answers, respectively.</p><p>To actually see the intelligence, Stupy made proposals of answers, when given a question. He would run the question through his current brain and print out the result. So you could see if he really “got it” or if he was just doing random guessing.</p><p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Well, no it wasn’t.</p><p>At first I was delighted: Stupy was fast! And he really <em>was</em> intelligent - or so it seemed. Let me reprint the first session here:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>human &gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt;
        human correction &gt;&gt;&gt; 2
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; hm no, wait............................ ah! Ok, got it!
</code></pre></div></div><p>Okay, easy - Stupy had created some Brainfuck program that transformed “1+1” into “2”. But there are a multitude of different ways to achieve this. So, let’s test <em>his</em> approach:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>human &gt;&gt;&gt; 2+1
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; 3
        human correction &gt;&gt;&gt;
                --&gt; right answer
</code></pre></div></div><p>Right answer! <em>Right answer</em>! I created intelligent live! I am the programming Uber-Lord! I… must train him more:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>human &gt;&gt;&gt; 1+2
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; 2
        human correction &gt;&gt;&gt; 3
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; hm no, wait............................
.................................................
[several lines of dots skipped]
.................................................
....... uh, I'm too stupid.
</code></pre></div></div><p>Oh.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>human &gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; 3
</code></pre></div></div><p>Oh-oh.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>human &gt;&gt;&gt; a
stupy &gt;&gt;&gt; b
</code></pre></div></div><p>Okay.</p><p>Turns out, Stupy wasn’t that intelligent. I increased the timeout, but still - even after 4 hours mutating and testing his brain, he didn’t get both “1+2” and “2+1” right at the same time.</p><p>Maybe Brainfuck wasn’t the best choice, after all.</p><p>PS: Some of Stupy’s brains:</p><p>(Note that my Brainfuck interpreter had a timeout <del datetime="2011-07-18T18:52:20+00:00">to solve the halting problem</del>. Besides, as you will notice, most “brains” are not well-formed Brainfuck programs - so some of these might not work with regular interpreters, much less compilers.)</p><p>“add one to first byte of input and print the result”</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;,+[.&lt;][]

This version uses many different brains (worst-case: one for each question-answer pair) and thus can answer both 1+2 and 2+1 correctly.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/the-turing-machine-vs-the-coffee-machine">The Turing Machine vs. The Coffee Machine</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/the-internet-the-best-internet-on-earth">The Internet - The Best Internet On Earth</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
