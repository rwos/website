Sounds simple, <em>is</em> simple - simply fun.</p><p>The problems start when you have to actually choose one of the possibilities. Today on my plate: assignment.</p><p>The assignment function (yes, function, not operator) will play a major role in my future programming language. As I have written before, it will basically be Forth-like. Which means, that it will have a dictionary. This dictionary (think “big hash map”) will contain everything - all the functions, all the global variables. Adding something to the dictionary will look something like this:</p> <pre>
    (ASSIGNMENT_SYMBOL "name" [code])</pre><p>or like this (both variants will be possible):</p> <pre>
    [code] "name" ASSIGNMENT_SYMBOL</pre><p>Now, it’s pretty clear that C’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> will read pretty bad. In my language’s syntax, something denoting the word “store” would be more natural. However, typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code> over and over again is just silly.</p><p>Forth has a word named <code class="highlighter-rouge">!</code> for storing things in memory. I think this is pretty sweet, but I’ve become too used to C using it for logical NOT.</p><p>Maybe <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code> would be a better choice. But it looks stupid when it stands on its own. And looks are important, right?</p><p>So, here I am, thinking about what symbol to use for assignment for about an hour now. I really have to work on my time management, I guess.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/screenshot-monday-1">Screenshot Monday 1</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/introducing-dadadodoweb">Introducing DadaDodoWeb</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/gherkin">Given When Then</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
