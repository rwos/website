Which was (unintentionally!) started by me asking if it’s now possible with Windows 7 to name a folder “aux”. Turns out it isn’t.</p><p>However, war was on. And that’s not a pretty thing to watch between die-hard Linux users and Windows fans. They tend to fight until both camps are basically destroyed.</p><p>While the battle was raging, I (even though being generally more on the Linux side of things) tried very hard to think of filename “gotchas” on Unix/Linux/POSIX systems. Just to give some balance to the discussion…</p><p>The example I came up with was naming a directory “*” in / and then trying to delete that. This wasn’t very creative and thus was generally not accepted by the Linux guys as a proof that POSIX systems had filename issues. Nothing could beat Windows’ “aux” idiocy, it seemed.</p><p>Now, incidentally, some <a href="http://forums.thedailywtf.com/forums/p/24739/262049.aspx">post on the DWTF forums</a> just pointed me to <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">a rich resource of POSIX filename fails</a>, created by David A. Wheeler. I will only cite some passages, in order to give the dear reader an impression of how fucked-up POSIX’ filename rules really are.</p><blockquote>Oh, and **don't display filenames**. Filenames could contain control characters that control the terminal (and X-windows), causing nasty side-effects on display. Displaying filenames can even cause a security vulnerability - and who expects *printing a filename* to be a vulnerability?!?</blockquote><p>…and…</p><blockquote>The list of problems that "leading dash filenames" creates is seemingly endless. You can't safely run "cat *", because there might be a file with a leading dash; if there's a file named "-n", then suddenly all the output is numbered if you use GNU cat. Not all programs support the "--" convention, so you can't simply say "precede all command lists with --", and in any case, people forget to do this in real life.</blockquote><p>…oh, and…</p><blockquote>Why the heck are the ASCII control characters (byte values 1 through 31, as well as 127) permitted in filenames? The point of filenames is to create human-readable names for collections of information, but since these characters aren't readable, the whole point of *having* filenames is lost.</blockquote><p>…so, let’s conclude:</p><blockquote>In a well-designed system, simple things should be simple, and the "obvious easy" way to do simple common tasks should be the correct way. I call this goal "*no sharp edges*" - to use an analogy, if you're designing a wrench, don't put razor blades on the handles. Typical Unix/Linux filesystems fail this test - they *do* have sharp edges. Because it's hard to do things the "right" way, many Unix/Linux programs simply assume that "filenames are reasonable", even though the system doesn't guarantee that this is true.</blockquote><p>Comparing these (and more) short-comings of UNIX’ design against the short-comings of Windows is left as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>The author is in a love-hate relationship with UNIX, anyway - no flame wars needed. But don’t say anything against Plan 9! :-)</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/screenshot-monday-0">Screenshot Monday 0</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/scope-creep">Scope Creep</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/linux-filename-fails">Linux Filename Fails</a>, <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a>, and <a href="/blog/test-driven">Test Driven Development</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
