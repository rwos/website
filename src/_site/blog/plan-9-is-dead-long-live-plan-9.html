Long Live Plan 9!</h1><p>2011-07-25<p>Now, that is <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/link/35742">great news</a>: a community-driven fork of Bell Labs’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9 Operating System</a>.</p><p>Finally, <a href="http://cat-v.org/">someone</a> taking actions to bring the most modern operating system of our day back to live.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-388" title="Glenda, Plan 9's mascot" src="http://r-wos.org/media/plan9bunnysmblack.jpg" alt="Glenda, Plan 9's mascot" width="154" height="180"/></p><p>If you are new to Plan 9: don’t let the <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/img/screenshot.gif">screenshots</a> fool you. They might look like any other late-80s system - but at its heart Plan 9 is much cleaner, more flexible and better thought-out than any other operating system on this earth. Including all of today’s Unices.</p><p>Plan 9 brought us UTF-8 and tiling window managers. And it invented <code class="highlighter-rouge">/proc</code>, the process file-system now adopted by Linux - to name but a few of Plan 9’s innovations. In fact, Plan 9 does <em>everything</em> with file systems - including networking and graphical user interfaces. Things, for which Unix sadly uses sockets and monsters like the X Window System.</p><p>Plan 9, on the other hand, is a clean system. A consistent system.</p><p><em>Plan 9 is Unix<sup>2</sup></em>.</p><p>It just rocks. And it’s a great thing to see it alive and kicking. The fork is called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/plan9front/">Plan 9 from The People’s Front of Cat-v.org</a> and lives at google code.</p><p>Among other things, they already added USB stick booting, ported mercurial, a Go compiler and Doom, and wrote a bunch of new drivers.</p><p>At this rapid pace, it’s going to overtake GNU/Linux in… Well, about 10 or 20 years, maybe.</p><p>So, jump on the train <em>now</em>, before it’s becoming a boring mainstream OS! ;-)</p><p>PS: I know, I’m a bit late on this - which is a shame, because I just recently (and before the news) added a “Plan 9 From Bell Labs” <em>Spark</em> (as they call it) on my Google+ profile. I thought that would add new findings about Plan 9 to my stream (like a Google Alert or something). But it seems that I <em>have to navigate to the Sparks page</em> to actually see the news. Which kind of defeats the purpose of adding something as a Spark. I would’ve seen it, I guess, if someone “shared” it with me, but you know the old joke: two Plan 9 users meet. End-of-joke.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/you-can-t-escape-the-string-escape">You Can't Escape The String Escape</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/q-your-ides-use-vi">:q! your IDEs - use vi</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a>, and <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
