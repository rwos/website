Or, if you’re using PHP, the language behind the PHP port <a href="http://behat.org/">behat</a>.</p><p>Tests usually look something like this (example lifted straight from cucumber’s docs):</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Feature: Serve coffee
  In order to earn money
  Customers should be able to
  buy coffee at all times

  Scenario: Buy last coffee
    Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine
    And I have deposited 1$
    When I press the coffee button
    Then I should be served a coffee
</code></pre></div></div><p>Which <em>is</em> very nice. Having tests that are as easily readable as this is obviously fantastic!</p><p>What is not nice is how it’s implemented. What is even less nice, is how it’s sold as a “business readable, domain specific language”. I can live very well with crude hacks, as long as the README states “it’s a crude hack”. Glancing over obvious limitations in exchange for marketing slogans bothers me, however. Among programmers, we should be honest first.</p><h2 id="intro">intro</h2><p>Let’s step through the test above:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Feature: Serve coffee
  In order to earn money
  Customers should be able to
  buy coffee at all times
</code></pre></div></div><p>This whole block is just a comment and subsequently ignored. You have to have one of those at the top of your files, and the block below <code class="highlighter-rouge">Feature</code> has to be indented, however.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Scenario: Buy last coffee
</code></pre></div></div><p>Another comment. Now comes the actual executable code:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine
And I have deposited 1$
When I press the coffee button
Then I should be served a coffee
</code></pre></div></div><p>Every line here is a “step”, and every step does something.</p><h2 id="assertions-and-instructions">assertions and instructions</h2><p>Even thought there are semantic differences between sentences beginning with with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Given</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">When</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Then</code> in English, they are all the same thing in Gherkin.</p><p>Suppose the first sentence</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine
</code></pre></div></div><p>sets up the machine to have 1 coffees [sic!] left. You start to run into problems once you now write a different test where the <em>outcome</em> should be that the machine has one coffee left. Say, something like this:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given there are 2 coffees left in the machine
When I order one coffee
Then there are 1 coffees left in the machine.
</code></pre></div></div><p>Perfectly reasonable for a human, but for Gherkin this translates to:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set up the machine to have 2 coffees left
order one coffee
set up the machine to have 1 coffee left
</code></pre></div></div><p>Which is not only not right, it’s not even wrong. This test will run and it will run <em>successfully</em> every time.</p><p>What Gherkin wants you to write is something like this:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given there are 2 coffees left in the machine
When I order one coffee
Then there should be 1 coffees left in the machine.
</code></pre></div></div><p>So that the programmers can implement the “there should be” sentence as an assertion, and the “there are” sentence as a instruction. Why is this difference not handled via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Given</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">Then</code> keywords? Who knows.</p><p>This minimalism/stupidity in Gherkin’s approach to parsing results in a programming language with extremely low orthogonality. In fact, there’s none at all. If you come across a step like</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine
</code></pre></div></div><p>this does <em>not</em> guarantee at all that</p><ul><li>there’s a step <code class="highlighter-rouge">Given there are 2 coffees left in the machine</code></li><li>there’s a step <code class="highlighter-rouge">Given there are 1 cappuccinos left in the machine</code></li><li>there’s a step <code class="highlighter-rouge">Then there should be 1 coffees left in the machine</code></li><li>and so on</li></ul><p>I think this is pretty confusing, <em>especially</em> for non-programmers. Also, depending on how you write your regexps, the step above is distinct from all of the following:</p><ul><li>Given there are 1 coffees  left in the machine</li><li>Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine.</li><li>Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine!</li><li>Given there are 1 coffee left in the machine</li><li>Given there is 1 coffee left in the machine</li><li>Given there is one coffee left in the machine</li><li>Given there are 1 coffees left</li><li>and so on</li></ul><p>This is easily traceable back to the simplistic implementation, but that doesn’t help anyone. Gherkin is aimed at non-technical folk - and it’s syntactically <em>less</em> forgiving than JavaScript! In terms of human-friendliness of the syntax it’s comparable to the older fixed-format versions of FORTRAN.</p><p>In other words: Gherkin is (or can be) nice to read, but it’s <em>extremely</em> unfriendly to write.</p><h2 id="2-problems">2 problems</h2><p>Let’s talk about the implementation. Gherkin is regexp-based</p> <strike>because that's an absolutely reasonable choice for parsing a natural language</strike><p>.</p><p>So, for every “step”, you have a regexp with some code behind it, that implements this step. It looks something like this (in cucumber, behat is a bit more verbose):</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given /I have deposited (\d+)\$/ do |n|
    @machine.deposit(n)
end
</code></pre></div></div><p>In other words: there is no Gherkin language. At all. Gherkin is a lexical scanner, nothing more. The parser (regexps) and evaluator (associated code) is solely in your hands to implement. And because Gherkin limits you to per-line regexps, the resulting Gherkin-based DSL is <em>less</em> capable than pretty much anything you could’ve come up with yourself.</p><p>In behat at least (I assume it’s the same in cucumber), there’s also no way to stack regexps. Every step has to match exactly <em>one</em> regexp. What that means is that you can’t special-case steps, and you can’t override them. (Well, you can, but it’s extremely hacky).</p><p>There are other limitations: It’s not possible to use the “language” itself to extend its functionality. You can’t write new Gherkin steps in Gherkin. (Again, technically the last sentence is wrong. You <em>can</em> do that but you’d have to implement it yourself and Gherkin won’t help you.)</p><h2 id="overtaken-by-a-pdp-6">overtaken by a PDP-6</h2><p>The <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/">shrdlu</a> program was much ahead of its time, and I’m not saying that its approach to natural language understanding would have been a good one for Gherkin to take in general.</p><p>However, at least one feature would be an obvious improvement to Gherkin, and not that hard to implement: The whole notation of context.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>When I type "foo" into the password box
Then it should change its color to red
And next to it "Your password is too short" should appear.
</code></pre></div></div><p>You <em>can</em> do something like that in Gherkin today but you’d have to implement it yourself. Which might not be that surprising at this point. Gherkin does almost nothing - Gherkin <em>is</em> almost nothing.</p><p>It’s just a small hack.</p><h2 id="bonus">bonus</h2><p>Here’s an implementation of the core of Gherkin in ~30 lines of Racket:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">#</span><span class="nv">lang</span> <span class="nv">racket</span>
