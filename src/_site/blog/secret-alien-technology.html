Knowing that I won’t be able to keep me motivated writing a whole game, I thought I’ll tinker a bit with terrain generation - a fairly easy way to do something exciting.</p><p>Now, my colleagues use C++, a language I don’t exactly like very much. I could have just used C, but in my usual way of spending too much time solving self-inflicted problems, I thought “why not common lisp?”.</p><p><img src="http://r-wos.org/media/lisplogo_warning_128.png"/></p><p>Well, I’ll tell you why not.</p><p>I spent the last two days getting a common lisp implementation to run some toy OpenGL example. Not the whole two days, mind you - but still much too much time.</p><p>Instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code>, lisp apparently uses something called <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code> (pro: very easy to type). Somehow, I missinterpreted what <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code> does - I though it was some kind of package system, but it’s “only” a dependency-resolving build tool. So, in my ignorance, I downloaded the lisp OpenGL binding packages in the hope they’d include documentation describing how to get them installed so that <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code> finds them. Well, that didn’t work out too well - the cl-opengl package comes with exactly zero install documentation. Great - off to <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code>’s manual.</p><p>That manual describes quite well where to place the package, and how to load it. The only problem is that cl-opengl in turn has quite some dependencies. And downloading them all manually can’t be the right way to do things. Besides, my <code class="highlighter-rouge">asdf</code> installation was a bit too old - and the new version changed the api for loading packages, of all things. Great, volume two.</p><p>Now, one <em>can</em> install/load the newer version using the old version - but I couldn’t figure out how to tell my lisp implementation (I use sbcl, by the way) to always use the newer one. Besides, I grew really tired of the whole process. This began to look like system administration</p><ul><li>fiddling with configuration files, adding paths in startup files… I hate that kind of thing, with a passion.</li></ul><p>The next day, after some googling, I found a thing called <code class="highlighter-rouge">quicklisp</code> which <em>is</em> a package system. Like, a real one! Success!</p><p>Quicklisp was like a breath of fresh air - friendly, telling you exactly what you need to do - and everything just worked. I got the OpenGL, Glut and Glu bindings installed, loaded the aforementioned example program - and there were colorful rotating pyramids! And music filled the air, and there were people dancing on the streets.</p><p>One remaining problem is that I don’t know how one would distribute a common lisp program in source form. Can I just assume everybody uses quicklisp? That doesn’t seem right.</p><p>On a side note: I’m really underwhelmed by the state of lisp programming tools - it’s 2012 and some Emacs mode is the absolute height of lisp programming? A REPL on steroids, with “online documentation”. Wow. That’s the superiority of lisp, something nearly as useful as Eclipse? They must be kidding. I really hope there’s something better out there I just haven’t found yet.</p><p>Also, the program startup takes ages (3 seconds or so, where it should take a fraction of a second), but that’s probably my fault. Everything <em>should</em> get compiled to machine code, but it seems like the external packages are loaded from source every time. Is there something like static linking in the lisp world? Who knows.</p><p>Well, I don’t. Everything seems so alien to me. There’s a whole lot of manuals waiting to be read, I guess.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/time">Time</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/oops">OOPs</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/secret-alien-technology">Secret Alien Technology</a>, <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, and <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
