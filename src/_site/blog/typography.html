It’s a surprisingly addictive way to waste time.</p><p>I’ve read Robert Bringhurst’s “The Elements of Typographic Style” and I rather liked it. The problem is, of course, once I’ve read it I couldn’t stop thinking about typography.</p><p>I know that I do a lot of things very wrong on this website - I use the wrong symbols for quotes, apostrophes, and dashes. I probably use the wrong fonts on the wrong places. That, and a million of other small details.</p><p>I don’t necessarily want <em>perfect</em> typography - but I’ve started to try and correct at least the most glaring errors (I know, I know, some might say that the biggest error is using green font on a green background - I obviously disagree about <em>that</em> one). I do like Futura, so I’ve changed the headlines to something vaguely like it (There aren’t that many free geometric fonts to choose from). I’ve also played a bit with the margins and line-heights and that sort of thing.</p><p>The result is nowhere near perfect but I do think it’s better than what things looked like before.</p><hr/><p>One great way to waste even more time is to design a font face. I obviously lack the expertise to do that properly - but that has never stopped me and it won’t now.</p><p>There quite a lot of open source font creation tools around - I’ve tried using <a href="http://fontforge.org/">FontForge</a>, a graphical outline editor, but the version that ships with Debian doesn’t seem to play very well with the tiling window manager I use. It’s also a quite powerful tool - too powerful for beginners like me.</p><p>I have then briefly looked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>, Donald Knuth’s font programming language. But while the concept is quite nice and easy things are surprisingly easy to achieve, the whole system is much too involved for my needs.</p><p>I don’t want to become a font designer, I just want to play around with a few parameters.</p><p>And, as luck would have it, I’ve just found a tool that does exactly that:</p><p><a href="http://www.metaflop.com/modulator">metaflop</a>, a web-based graphical user interface for METAFONT. Including webfont export.</p><p>I’ve only found that thing an hour ago and I can’t stop playing with it. It’s really well made, and you don’t have to know anything about fonts to use it. It’s a lot of fun.</p><p>Well, only if you use the same strange definition of “fun” as I do, of course.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/tacit-racket-2">Tacit Programming in Racket, Part 2</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/links">Links</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/typography">Playing with Typography</a>, <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, and <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
