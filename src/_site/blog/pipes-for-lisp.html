Thinking about that, a stupid idea formed in my head:</p><p><em>What if Lisp had pipes?</em></p><p>You know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29" target="_blank">pipes, as in “<code class="highlighter-rouge">|</code>”</a>. These fabulous little things known from such nice expressions like “<code class="highlighter-rouge">grep whatever * | more</code>” or “<code class="highlighter-rouge">cat stuff | sort | uniq</code>”.</p><p>Now, imagine how bad the last example would look, if the unix shell was lisp-like: <code class="highlighter-rouge">(uniq(sort(cat stuff)))</code>. (Well, maybe <em>bad</em> is the wrong word. Still, I think it looks considerably cleaner in shell-syntax.)</p><p>Now, if Lisp had my proposed, to-be-implemented, pipe-enabling, <del>world-changing</del>, preprocessor, it would look like this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat stuff | sort | uniq</code> - which is in fact identical to the shell version. Piping a command into another one would be the equivalent of using it (the first one) as the 2. command’s parameter. Like so: <code class="highlighter-rouge">(define ls (list 1 2))</code> could become <code class="highlighter-rouge">list 1 2 | define ls</code>.</p><p>As you can see, that wouldn’t change or break a lot - it would just give us programmers a way to more-or-less reverse the reading order of expressions. Which could come in handy in those case where Lisp’s natural order reads awkwardly inverted.</p><p>In case you asking: I am fully aware of the fact that - with the examples given above - this looks neither helpful, nor lispy, nor even remotely like something anybody would want to have.</p><p>Well, I’ll be back (with a prototype) to discuss this idea some more. Oh, hacking, you got me back…</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/arbitrary-limits-or-64-bits-ought-to-be-enough-for-anybody">Arbitrary Limits, or "64 Bits ought to be enough for anybody"</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/google-chrome-wasting-screen-estate">Google Chrome: Wasting Screen Estate</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/gherkin">Given When Then</a>, <a href="/blog/noflo">NoUnderstand NoFlo</a>, and <a href="/blog/forever-gui-2">A Graphical Forever Project, Part 2</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
