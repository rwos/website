I’m passable (not “good”, just passable) in JavaScript but I don’t get why anyone would ever want to program in the style node.js dictates.</p><p>It’s async, yeah. <em>Only</em> async. And async without language-level promises, or channels, or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code>. Or multi-processing. Or anything really. They basically write in continuation passing style. In one thread. By hand. And it wouldn’t completely surprise me if they chiseled it in stone and OCR’d it back.</p><p>If you are going backwards, you might as well go all the way.</p><p>Let’s make two HTTP requests, shall we?</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var result_1, result 2;
http.get("http://one.com",
  function(response) {
    response.on('data',
      function(data) {
        result_1 = data;
        http.get("http://two.com",
          function(response) {
            response.on('data',
              function(data) {
                result_2 = data;
                // do stuff with the results
              }

</code></pre></div></div><p>The fuck? Now, there are libraries that transform that pyramid of callbacks into a single one - but that’s just a cosmetic change. It’s still a series of callbacks. And - as far as I understand - there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">force(promise)</code> - in other words, no way to sync.</p><p>Why don’t they just do it synchronously? Why is there no blocking API? I don’t get it.</p><p>Note that this doesn’t have anything to do with performance. If I want the two requests to succeed before going on, I’ll have to wait for them - in both async and synchronous style.</p><p>The only thing that that async fuck-up buys me is that I now have a bunch of needlessly nested scopes.</p><p>Did I mention that I don’t get it?</p><p>Sure, <em>sometimes</em> it’s quite nice to do stuff asynchronously. Maybe it’s even a good idea to make non-blocking the default. But <em>only</em> non-blocking APIs?</p><p>Did I mention that…</p><p>Oh, yeah, I think I did.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/second-coffeescript">CoffeeScript - Second Impressions</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/racket-appreciation-day">Racket Appreciation Day</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/wtf-js">wtf.js</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
