And unfortunately it looks a bit like me trying to take credit for his work, which I really do not intend to do - so let me explain, why I did this.</p><p>Last week or so, I tried to build <code class="highlighter-rouge">squint</code> (that’s the official name of this marvelous piece of software) on a machine running Ubuntu 10.10, which gave strange warnings about a gcc built-in being called with a wrong type.</p><p>This seemed odd, given that the version I tried to build was explicitly marked as the “Linux” version (which implies that using gcc is okay) and not too old, either (2000, okay that’s eleven years, but still).</p><p>When I tried to run some test program through the interpreter, it died with a segmentation fault. Now, this was <em>really</em> odd. I hooked up gdb and it seemed that it died on a strlen() call somewhere deep in the lexer.</p><p>Now, it <em>is</em> pretty easy to write a sloppy C program that dies on a strlen() - just handle it a char array without a terminating NUL byte and off you go. But lexers are usually super-simple and, last but not least, it was friggin’ Rob Pike who wrote it.</p><p>Clearly, there was something very wrong. And probably <em>not</em> the code itself.</p><p>So I though to myself “okay, let’s debug this sometime, and upload the modern version to github” - thinking that gcc probably changed some default behavior over the years and I just needed to add something to CFLAGS to make up for that.</p><p>Fast forward a week including an update to the latest Ubuntu, <a href="http://blog.r-wos.org/2011/fuck-unity-fuck-gnome3-i-m-going-to-downgrade">a disgusted look</a>, and a downgrade to 10.04 LTS (i.e. “long term support”).</p><p>I had some time on my hands and tried to tackle this <code class="highlighter-rouge">squint</code> thing again.</p><p>I typed <code class="highlighter-rouge">make all</code> - and, lo and behold, no warning, but one error. The error was about some pretty strange <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">sys/wait.h</code> but with an absolute path instead of, well, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sys/wait.h</code>.</p><p>So I removed the statement - and everything, including running the test programs, just worked. I thought “cool, fixed it” and uploaded it to github. Then I realized that the value of that one-line “fix” is, well, not too high, actually…</p><p>So now it looks like I took some software from one place, did absolutely nothing on it, and uploaded it to another place, but with my name added. Not that anybody cares, but I just wanted to explain the whole story so I can stop feeling bad about it.</p><p>What also helps is that Newsqueak is a pretty neat (and mostly forgotten) language. It has, among other nice things, basically typed named-pipe elements at the language level. And there’s a language-level <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> for these things, too. So that’s pretty cool and powerful, while still easy to reason about. But the real language overview will have to wait until the next post - I have to really learn it, first. :)</p><p>Happy Hacking!</p><p>(<strong>Update</strong>: Well, it was (and is) a problem with the code. Some of the plan9 libraries included with squint don’t build for 64 bit targets (or well, they <em>do</em> build, but they die at runtime). I thought it was dependent on the gcc version, because I switched that and forgot that I switched to a 32 bit CPU at the same time. Word-size depend bugs never occured to me before, so this wasn’t exactly my first though on what was going wrong.)</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/fuck-unity-fuck-gnome3-i-m-going-to-downgrade">Fuck Unity, Fuck GNOME3, I'm going to downgrade</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/adventures-with-newsqueak-part-2">Adventures with Newsqueak, part 2</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/test-driven">Test Driven Development</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
