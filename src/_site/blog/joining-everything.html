It’s not that I <em>really</em> expect anything to come out of just having a profile on whathaveyou.com, but you never know, right? Besides, it’s effort-less and free and all that.</p><p>So, here’s some first-impression “review” kind of thing for the sites I have a profile on. It’s also a reminder for myself, because I keep forgetting where I clicked that “register” link again…</p><p><a href="http://coderwall.com/rwos">coderwall</a> - I don’t know <em>what</em> it is, but it’s fun connecting the thing to your github account and reading through the achievements. I even got two “api design” achievements because a lot of people forked the couple of lines of C I wrote some time ago. So, the badges alone might not be the greatest indicator for programming ability, but it sure is nice to look at.</p><p><a href="http://xing.de">Xing</a> - Like linkedin, but more successful than that in Germany. Facebook for adults. Stupid, but occasionally funny how everyone tries to act “professional”. It’s not my kind of place, but I do sometimes get recruiting messages. As of now, they all looked like spam to me, though.</p><p><a href="http://linkedin.com">linkedin</a> - Like Xing, but less successful than that in Germany.</p><p><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> - A stupid site full of ads that rarely works at all. You might have heard about it.</p><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102346113359431653890">Google+</a></p><ul><li>A much quieter, but also much more intelligent place (depending on who’s in your circles of course). Annoyingly feature-less for the width of technical discussions that happen on it (no threaded comments, not possible to display code verbatim, etc.).</li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/r_wos">Twitter</a> - No idea what that is for. I have an account, because… I don’t know really. I have another account where I had a bot post some markov-chain stuff some time ago, but that’s dead, too. I <em>hate</em> their website, and their stupid URL-shortener and all the other stupid ideas they come up with.</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1070069/rwos">stackoverflow</a> - A good resource, but I generally dislike the community.</p><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/rwos/">reddit</a> - Not a good resource, but I do like the community.</p><p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rwos">hacker news</a> - Sometimes a good resources, sometimes not. The people there are knowledgeable and friendly at times, but sometimes they’re neither. Much smaller than reddit, which is mostly good - but larger than /r/programming, which is mostly bad.</p><p><a href="http://github.com/rwos">Github</a> - <em>The</em> best source code sharing site around. Not all that good for wikis or issue tracking, but then again neither is Google Code or Launchpad or CodePlex.</p><p><a href="http://codeplex.com">CodePlex</a> - Microsoft’s Github clone. Nice to look at but slow as molasses. I only joined that one for a school project.</p><p><a href="https://koding.com/">Koding</a> - A slow, personal VM accessed via a slow in-browser terminal. I’ve obviously signed up for the beta some time ago, because I received an invite last month or so. I haven’t really tried do anything real with it, but the concept seems nice. In a “that’s so stupid it’s cool again” way.</p><p><a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/">OpenShift</a> - Red Hat’s free open source cloud thingy. I signed up because was free and then realized that I didn’t know what to do with it. You do get a full red hat linux system, though, so that’s nice.</p><p>That would be it, though I’m sure I forgot some. I probably hit that “register” button far too often…</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/multimedia">Multimedia</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/hardly-any-python-hardly-any-cry">Hardly Any Python, Hardly Any Cry</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/joining-everything">Joining Everything</a>, <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, and <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
