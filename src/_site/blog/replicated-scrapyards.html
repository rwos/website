It’s funny <em>how</em> much of unfinished, buggy, segfaulting stuff accumulates over the years.</p><p>Now, I could just go and delete all that code, I’m not going to touch it anymore, anyway. But - well, I can’t.</p><p>And since this is 2012 and there’s unlimited space in <em>the cloud</em>, I just opened a <a href="https://github.com/rwos/scrapyard">scrapyard repository on github</a>.</p><p>I’m not just dumping any old files in there - I <em>do</em> make sure things compile and run (most of the time) and I’m writing a small README for each project.</p><p>For now, I’ve uploaded an attempt at constructing an artificial intelligence from brainfuck programs. That, maybe not surprisingly, turned out to be a spectacularly bad idea. I’ve <a href="http://blog.r-wos.org/2011/artificial-stupidity">written about that some time ago</a>.</p><p>And I’ve uploaded what is basically a graphical compiler-error-message viewer. It shows compiler error messages translated into pretty (well, not <em>pretty</em>) animations. It’s an idea with a great future (NOT). If anybody wants to continue working on it - you can now go ahead and make your dreams come true (<em>no no no no no</em>). Here’s a screenshot:</p><p><img src="http://r-wos.org/media/gccstreet.png" style="max-width:90%"/></p><p>All in all, this repository is not - and will never be - of any value to anybody. And no users means no bugs, right?</p><p>And I can sleep well, knowing that my little hacks now live save from any danger, triple-replicated and 24/7 monitored on some US hard drives.</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/well-that-didn-t-work-out-so-well">Well, that didn't work out so well</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/greetings-from-mandelbrot">Greetings from Mandelbrot</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/test-driven">Test Driven Development</a>, <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, and <a href="/blog/german-programming-apprenticeship-review">The German Programming Apprenticeship - A Review</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
