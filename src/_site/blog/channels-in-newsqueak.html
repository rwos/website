For instance via - you guessed it - playing with Newsqueak.</p><p>So, today in our series of <del>“nobody is interested, please stop”</del> “Fun with Newsqueak”: Channels.</p><p>The idea goes back to C.A.R. Hoare’s <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> or CSP.</p><p>The thing is basically that processes communicate by writing to and reading from unbuffered (i.e. <em>blocking</em>), named channels. Sounds simple, is simple - and that’s in fact what it was done for in the first place.</p><p>CSP is not (necessarily) a programming technique for scaling programs to multi-processor machines but more a system that makes some programs easier to write and understand. Of course, <em>if</em> suddenly some multi-processor machines come along, your programs will be ready - but that’s not the point.</p><p>Using channels makes programs more elegant. <em>That</em> is the point.</p><p>So, let’s talk about a nice little program that Hoare credits to Doug McIlroy (aka the guy who invented the unix-shell pipe (which is, more or less, just a two-dimensional channel (and was invented <em>before</em> Hoare wrote his book (that should be enough historic context for now)))).</p><p>The specific (Newsqueak-)implementation I’ll be using was (probably) written by Rob Pike. It’s an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, the well-known prime number sieve.</p><p>But first, some Newsqueak basics: Newsqueak looks pretty much like C, but with Pascal-style declarations and first-class functions (<code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code>s).</p><p>If you want to try it out for yourself, you might want to <a href="http://github.com/rwos/Newsqueak">grab squint</a>, the interpreter.</p><p>This</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>i:int;
</code></pre></div></div><p>declares a variable of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> named “i”. This</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>i:=1;
</code></pre></div></div><p>declares a variable of a to-be-decided-on type and assigns the number one to it. As 1 is an integer, i is an integer, too. This automatic type inference only works when declaring the variable.</p><p>The rest is pretty much like in C, and should be readable - so, let’s step through some code for a simple counter, implemented using channels.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>counter:=prog(end: int, c: chan of int) {
</code></pre></div></div><p>First, we declare a variable “counter” and assign a <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> to it. A <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> is a literal function, it works much like Javascript’s “function” syntax, for example. This is the function definition.</p><p>The first argument is of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> and the second is… special. :-)</p><p>It is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">chan</code>nel of int - a thing we can write integers into and read integers from.</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    i:int;
    for(i=2; i&lt;end; i++)
        c&lt;-=i;
</code></pre></div></div><p>Now, we loop through all integers from 2 to <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> and write them into the channel. This line</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        c&lt;-=i;
</code></pre></div></div><p>does the writing and parses as:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>c   # the channel
&lt;-  # the "write into channel" operator (it points towards the channel)
=   # assignment operator
i   # what we are assigning
</code></pre></div></div><p>Oh, and don’t we forget the closing brackets and the semicolon:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>};
</code></pre></div></div><p>Putting everything together:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>counter:=prog(end: int, c: chan of int) {
    i:int;
    for(i=2; i&lt;end; i++)
        c&lt;-=i;
};
</code></pre></div></div><p>Easy, right? Now, how does this execute?</p><p>Well, channels are unbuffered, thus blocking. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">counter</code> is called with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> of, say, 100, it will first try to write the integer <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> into the channel. But since no-one is reading from the channel, and since the channel is unbuffered, that write will block. The program will stop until someone comes forward and reads from the channel, receiving the <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>. The next block will be encountered when the <code class="highlighter-rouge">counter</code> tries to write the 3 (and nobody reads) - and so on.</p><p>As you can see, we’ll need some <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> reading from the channel - and that <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> better ran concurrent with <code class="highlighter-rouge">counter</code>!</p><p>Enter Newsqueak’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">begin</code> statement, which helps us here. You can <code class="highlighter-rouge">begin</code> a <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> and off it goes, not blocking further program execution. It behaves like fork-and-exec, but it’s cheaper and simpler.</p><p>Let’s construct a simple “reader” <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code>:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>reader:=prog(c: chan of int) {
    i:int;
    for (;;) {
        # reading from c (note the arrow pointing to the left)
        i=&lt;-c;
        print(i, "\n");
    }
};
</code></pre></div></div><p>This one should be obvious by now: it tries to read from the integer channel <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> in an infinite loop (but it won’t loop all the time: read operations block, too, if there’s nothing to read). When it got some integer off the channel, it just prints it (and a newline).</p><p>Now we combine this <code class="highlighter-rouge">prog</code> with the counter from above and invoke the mechanism with the following three lines:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>count:=mk(chan of int); # mk ("make") is like "new" in other languages:
                        # an object creator, if you will.
                        # "count" is now a chan of int,
                        # nothing special happened
begin counter(100, count);
begin reader(count);
</code></pre></div></div><p>What happens? The <code class="highlighter-rouge">counter</code> will (try to) “pump” numbers into the channel, while the <code class="highlighter-rouge">reader</code> gets them off and prints them.</p><p>These 2 processes communicate via the blocking channel alone - we don’t have to stop them, or otherwise control execution. We just pushed the start button and off they went.</p><p>Again: these are <em>not</em> necessarily processes in the operating-system meaning of the term - they don’t <em>have to</em> run in parallel, and they are cheaper than “real” processes. You might as well create thousands of them, if you need to.</p><p>In case you wondered: yes, this example is silly. The following, however, is not. Take the counter from above, but don’t connect it with the reader. Take this recursive, filter-creating filter instead:</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># "rec" keyword needed for recursive progs
rec filter:=prog(listen: chan of int)
{
    i:int;
    prime:=&lt;-listen;
    print(prime, " ");
    send:=mk(chan of int);
    begin filter(send);
    for(;;)
        if((i=&lt;-listen)%prime)
            send&lt;-=i;
};
</code></pre></div></div><p>…and you have the Sieve of Eratosthenes, implemented in just a couple of lines.</p><p>Quite an elegant brain-teaser, isn’t it?</p><p>Still not interested? Well, what a shame…</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/adventures-with-newsqueak-part-2">Adventures with Newsqueak, part 2</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/modern-programming">Modern Programming</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/channels-in-newsqueak">Channels in Newsqueak</a>, <a href="/blog/gherkin">Given When Then</a>, and <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
