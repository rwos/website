That means it’s time to think about games, again.</p><p>First: the platform of choice: I’ve actually been pretty happy with what I chose last time - JavaScript and the usual 2D-Canvas stuff. It was fast to program in, performed well enough and worked on every platform. So, I’m absolutely sure I’ll be using JavaScript again - though maybe I won’t directly write in it, this time around.</p><p>One possibility would be to use <a href="http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/">Whalesong</a>, a Racket-to-JavaScript compiler thing. I don’t have any illusions - writing the whole thing in Racket won’t make me code any faster, or the game any better. But it would be a nice challenge, I think. Could be fun.</p><p>The other idea that came to me just yesterday was to use some JavaScript implementation of a machine or something. Like, writing the whole thing in C64-BASIC and letting it run on a JavaScript C64 emulator. Or in C and letting it run on a JavaScript Linux VM. That would be even cooler than writing it in Racket - but it does introduce quite a lot of problems. The biggest of which will probably be the really, really bad performance of the whole thing. Well, we’ll see.</p><p>For the game’s engine, I’m currently playing around with various software rendering stuff - I have a …well, a thing …one could call it a stochastic ray-caster. It produces very nice low-tech, pseudo-retro kind of effects.</p><p><img src="http://r-wos.org/media/rand-raycast.png" style="max-width:100%"/></p><p>I really do like software renderers. I’m not very good at writing them (too bad at math), but I do like just how much crazy stuff you can do with a software renderer that would be hard or impossible to do with the usual hardware-accelerated 3D-APIs.</p><p>For the game’s content - well, let’s wait for the official theme announcement, shall we?</p><p>This Ludum Dare, I won’t have the whole weekend for coding. But if my last attendance is any indication, time won’t be too big of a problem.</p><p>…well, no actually, I got that wrong. Time will be <em>the</em> biggest problem of them all.</p><p>In other news: work is currently <em>exceptionally</em> boring. I really enjoy programming, like <em>really</em> - but the things I’m currently forced to do at work, and the context I’m doing them in, are killing all the fun.</p><p>So, by way of variety, I’ve done something completely pointless: I’ve integrated a Scheme interpreter into <a href="http://r-wos.org/about">my about page</a>. It really works! If you don’t know Scheme try <code class="highlighter-rouge">(+ 40 2)</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">((lambda (x) (* x x)) 12)</code> for a start.</p><p>It’s the little things in life… :-)</p><hr><h2>See Also</h2><p>Previously: <a href="/blog/art">Art</a></p><p>Next up: <a href="/blog/doesnt-seem-safe">This doesn't seem safe to me</a></p><p> The machine thinks that the Web-Log entries <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">26th Ludum Dare - Postmortem</a>, <a href="/blog/purely-functional-games">Purely Functional Games</a>, and <a href="/blog/ludum-dare-postmortem">Ludum Dare Postmortem</a> might be related to the topic so eloquently discussed above.
