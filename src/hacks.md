<p>Some old, quick hacks - not polished - hardly usable - use at own risk, if at all</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rwos">source code</a> is available, too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/hacks/gti">gti</a> - An implementation of the command I keep typing all day long.

                  (a/href "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/" "Ludum Dare")
                  " 48h game programming competition."))

              "An interactive, zoom-able real-time rendering of the
               Mandelbrot set, using random points and Voronoi tessellation.")

              ,(j "A pixel-based grey-scale Mandelbrot set renderer with
                   super-sampling. It renders in arbitrary resolutions and
                   works pretty well for generating desktop wallpapers."))
            `("img2ascii" "/hacks/img2ascii"
              ,(j "A line-based image-to-ascii converter. It doesn't work
                   too well, but it's so simple it's a wonder it works at
                   all. Please use Chrome or Chromium for this one."))))
