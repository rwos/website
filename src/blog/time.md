Today I learned: A full compile of `llvm` and `clang` takes about half an
hour on my machine. One 48th of a day. About one-eighth of my leisure
time.

I'd like to schedule a meeting with the inventor of that whole 40-hour
week thing. 8-8-8 is a neat idea, but only if you teleport yourself
to work the very moment your alarm clock rings - and back home again,
after exactly 480 minutes of working without a pause. Then, you'll have
exactly 28800 seconds for "recreation", before you beat yourself to sleep
in a sub-second.

I don't think it works that way.
