Ludum Dare 26 - Timelapse
2013-04-29

The 26th [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) game programming
competition was this weekend. The theme was "minimalism".

I wrote a game called "::.::::::.". It can be played [over
here](http://r-wos.org/hacks/ld26/) (use Chrome
if you can).

I don't have a post-mortem handy (this time around, I'll wait with that until
the ratings are in) but the timelapse has just finished uploading:

It was a whole lot of fun, as always. And now I have to play-test and
rate the little over 1000 games the others wrote.

Excuse me for a moment - I have work to do.  :-)
