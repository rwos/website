Hardly Any Python, Hardly Any Cry
2012-11-20

Hey! News from the time wasting department: This blog is now available
under a new URL: [http://r-wos.org/blog/](http://r-wos.org/blog/).
The old links *should* get a 301 redirect here, though. Hope that works for
everybody. Don't ask how the redirect is implemented - trust me, you don't want
to know.

Also, the blog's now generated by an ugly little Racket program (it was
formally generated by an ugly little Python program).  Well, actually, Racket
doesn't have a Markdown parser yet, so that part's still done with Python.
Don't ask. You *really* don't want to know.

I hope the RSS readers can cope with a 301 redirect.  I hope the RSS is still
working. I hope I can move the Disqus comments. I hope I can fix the encoding
errors.

And I hope I remember why I did this again.
