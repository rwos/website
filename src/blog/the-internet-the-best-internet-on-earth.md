The Internet - The Best Internet On Earth

While <del>wasting some time on the web</del> doing some research for my yet-to-be-written minimalist programming language, I found <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MinimalistLanguage">this</a>:
<blockquote>Define "simple". Define "usable". Define Universe, and give three examples. Complexity has to go somewhere. You can push it around a lot, but it has to be somewhere. It could be in the number of language constructs, in the power of the few, simple, generic constructs, or in the code you write to overcome the excess simplicity of the language.</blockquote>
"Define Universe, and give three examples" is now officially added to my repertoire of answers to wrong questions. Finally - no more explaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_%28negative%29">Mu</a> to everyone! :-)
