Replicated Scrapyards
2012-08-03

I'm currently in the process of going through all the source code on my
machine, trying to sort it. It's funny *how* much of unfinished, buggy,
segfaulting stuff accumulates over the years.

Now, I could just go and delete all that code, I'm not going to touch it
anymore, anyway. But - well, I can't.

And since this is 2012 and there's unlimited space in *the cloud*, I just
opened a <a href="https://github.com/rwos/scrapyard">scrapyard repository
on github</a>.

I'm not just dumping any old files in there - I *do* make sure things compile
and run (most of the time) and I'm writing a small README for each project.

For now, I've uploaded an attempt at constructing an artificial intelligence
from brainfuck programs. That, maybe not surprisingly, turned out to be a
spectacularly bad idea. I've
<a href="http://blog.r-wos.org/2011/artificial-stupidity">written about that
some time ago</a>.

And I've uploaded what is basically a graphical compiler-error-message
viewer. It shows compiler error messages translated into pretty (well, not
*pretty*) animations. It's an idea with a great future (NOT). If anybody wants
to continue working on it - you can now go ahead and make your dreams come
true (*no no no no no*).
Here's a screenshot:

All in all, this repository is not - and will never be - of any value to
anybody. And no users means no bugs, right?

And I can sleep well, knowing that my little hacks now live save from
any danger, triple-replicated and 24/7 monitored on some US hard drives.
