Canvas Game Of Life
2011-09-15

A <a href="http://killbodyeatsoul.net/stuff">colleague</a> of mine recently introduced me to the language/framework called <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>.

It's a Java-based visualization language. It's meant to be a quick tool, targeting artists - and not necessarily programmers. So it's pretty simple to use. But the coolest thing about it is this:

It actually works.

I don't think that Processing is my new favourite programming language, but still - it's a whole lot of fun. This is what I came up with, after about 2 hours playing around:

<a href="http://r-wos.org/processing/index.html">The Canvas Game Of Life</a> (a pretty silly "living" drawing applet)

So, I'm impressed: Something built with Java does actually work. Like, even on Linux and all that. Okay, the IDE sucks, but for 100 or so lines of code, I can live with it.

Recreational Programming FTW!
