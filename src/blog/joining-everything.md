Joining Everything
2012-11-15

My apprenticeship is rapidly nearing its end, so over the last few months I joined
pretty much every social network kind of thing I've come across. It's not that
I *really* expect anything to come out of just having a profile on
whathaveyou.com, but you never know, right? Besides, it's effort-less and
free and all that.

So, here's some first-impression "review" kind of thing for the sites
I have a profile on. It's also a reminder for myself, because I keep
forgetting where I clicked that "register" link again...

<a href="http://coderwall.com/rwos">coderwall</a> - I don't know *what* it
is, but it's fun connecting the thing to your github account and reading
through the achievements. I even got two "api design" achievements because
a lot of people forked the couple of lines of C I wrote some time ago.
So, the badges alone might not be the greatest indicator for programming
ability, but it sure is nice to look at.

<a href="http://xing.de">Xing</a> - Like linkedin, but more successful than
that in Germany. Facebook for adults. Stupid, but occasionally funny how
everyone tries to act "professional". It's not my kind of place, but I do
sometimes get recruiting messages. As of now, they all looked like spam to me, though.

<a href="http://linkedin.com">linkedin</a> - Like Xing, but less successful
than that in Germany.

<a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> - A stupid site full of ads
that rarely works at all. You might have heard about it.

<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102346113359431653890">Google+</a>
- A much quieter, but also much more intelligent place (depending
on who's in your circles of course). Annoyingly feature-less for the
width of technical discussions that happen on it (no threaded comments,
not possible to display code verbatim, etc.).

<a href="https://twitter.com/r_wos">Twitter</a> - No idea what that is for.
I have an account, because... I don't know really. I have another account
where I had a bot post some markov-chain stuff some time ago, but that's
dead, too. I *hate* their website, and their stupid URL-shortener and
all the other stupid ideas they come up with.

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1070069/rwos">stackoverflow</a> - A good
resource, but I generally dislike the community.

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/rwos/">reddit</a> - Not a good resource, but I do like the community.

<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rwos">hacker news</a> - Sometimes
a good resources, sometimes not. The people there are knowledgeable and friendly at times, but sometimes
they're neither. Much smaller than reddit, which is mostly good - but larger than /r/programming,
which is mostly bad.

<a href="http://github.com/rwos">Github</a> - *The* best source code sharing
site around. Not all that good for wikis or issue tracking, but then again neither
is Google Code or Launchpad or CodePlex.

<a href="http://codeplex.com">CodePlex</a> - Microsoft's Github clone. Nice
to look at but slow as molasses. I only joined that one for a school project.

<a href="https://koding.com/">Koding</a> - A slow, personal VM accessed via a
slow in-browser terminal. I've obviously signed up for the beta some time ago,
because I received an invite last month or so. I haven't really tried do
anything real with it, but the concept seems nice. In a "that's so stupid it's
cool again" way.

<a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/>OpenShift</a> - Red Hat's free open
source cloud thingy. I signed up because was free and then realized that
I didn't know what to do with it. You do get a full red hat linux system,
though, so that's nice.

That would be it, though I'm sure I forgot some. I probably hit that
"register" button far too often...
