This:

<iframe width="480" height="360" style="width:100%" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m9joBLOZVEo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

is really nice. It's apparently also [a book](http://www.amazon.com/10-PRINT-CHR-205-5-RND/dp/0262018462)
but more importantly it's just one elegant line of BASIC:

    10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10

or [a line of bash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13611501/bash-version-of-c64-code-art-10-print-chr205-5rnd1-goto-10/13612327#13612327)

<pre>yes 'c=(&#9585; &#9586;);printf ${c[RANDOM%2]}' | bash</pre>

Beautiful, isn't it? On a somewhat related note, I now own the domain
code-museum.org - but I now that I have it, I realized that I don't really know
what to do with it.  I just thought - well, this is art. Art is in museums. We
need a museum for that.

Turns out, it's not that easy to find other exhibits. I do know about another
one-liner, in APL, which is even cooler (yep, I do mean that Game of Life
thing) - but other than that? There are maybe two or three *really* nice entries
from the International Obfuscated C Contest that I would include, too. I'll
have to check the licenses first, though. 

All I'm saying is - I guess - think twice before you buy domains.

Happy hacking!
