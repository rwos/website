      <p>I'm not a big fan of anything in list form, really, but I do keep TODO lists.
I'm currently using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> for that.</p>
<p>Trello is great, but it invites one (well, me) to play with it. That is, to
create new lists and re-order stuff and label it and re-label it, and so on.
The result is that I now have a very nice TODO list but I've done nothing. I
knew I had to stop using Trello after I created a meta-TODO list for the TODO
lists some days ago. That's getting seriously unhealthy...</p>
<p>I think the main problem is that Trello lives in the browser, but the stuff I
want to do lives (mostly) in <code>~/src</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it's a well-known law in programming that every programmer has to
write a hello-world program, a blog engine, and a TODO organizer.</p>
<p>So I did what I had todo (ahem) and wrote a small program that finds TODO and
GOAL files in <code>~/src</code>, orders them by age, and displays them (oldest first).</p>
<p>I called it &quot;slacker&quot;, obviously.</p>
<img src="http://r-wos.org/media/slacker.png" style="max-width:100%">
<p>No, it's not pretty. We'll see if it helps.</p>
<p><small>PS: The code is <a href="https://github.com/rwos/slacker">on github</a> if you want
it - though it's currently more a small hack than anything else. It works on
Linux/X11 and <em>should</em> work on Mac OS X and Windows, too.</small></p>
