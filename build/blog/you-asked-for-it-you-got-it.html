<p>I'm alone. Alone with one of the most legendary operating system of all times: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System" target="_blank">ITS</a>.</p>
<p>You really should try it. It will be easy to setup on one of your spare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10" target="_blank">PDP-10</a>s. Just in case you don't have a spare PDP-10 lying around: there's an excellent historic machine simulator called <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/" target="_blank">simh</a> (Free Software and runs on most unices). Setting up ITS on the simulated PDP is not exactly simple, but I found this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070826152708/http://www.cosmic.com/u/mirian/its/itsbuild.html" target="_blank">step-by-step description</a> to work quite well.</p>
<p>It's quite a nice thing to be able to emulate a monster like the PDP-10 on a small black plastic thingy called &quot;Travelmate&quot;. Tells you something 'bout <em>progress</em> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore's Law</a> and stuff...</p>
<p>Now, after booting ITS greets you with the prompt showed above - and that's it. There is no login needed.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right: <em>no login</em>. Full access to everything. For everyone. <em>On a multi-user operating system</em>. Quite a pleasant environment! No wonder ITS was one of the <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/staff/magi/personal/humour/Shaggy_Dog/Jargon%20File%20Version%202.1.1.html" target="_blank">roots of the hacker culture</a> - free information, no barriers, <del>flower power</del>, right?</p>
<p>There's a lot of ITS-based hacker folklore floating around. The standard editor on ITS, for instance, is <a href="http://www.ee.ryerson.ca:8080/%7Eelf/hack/realmen.html" target="_blank">commonly described</a> as the unfriendliest piece of software ever made: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Editor_and_Corrector" target="_blank">TECO</a> is probably the ultimate <em>You Asked For It - You Got It</em> program.</p>
<blockquote>Just about any possible typing error while talking with TECO will probably destroy your program, or even worse - introduce subtle and mysterious bugs in a once working subroutine.</blockquote>
Now, that's not unlike what the Windows-Guys say about vi and the unix shell, nowadays. So let's step in and see what it's all about!

A HACTRN (think DDT, think shell) is up and running - let's start TECO:</p>
<pre>:TECO
SYS: SYS3; TS TECO - NON-EXISTENT DIRECTORY</pre>
<p>Hm, must be making something wrong... Let's get some help:</p>
<pre>:INFO
SYS: SYS3; TS INFO - NON-EXISTENT DIRECTORY
:LISTF
DSK: ___002; .FILE. (DIR) - NON-EXISTENT DIRECTORY</pre>
<p>Eh, what?</p>
<p>Well, it seems that either my ITS installation is lacking some files, or I, as the prototypical luser, am doing something very stupid... Maybe I have to mount some stuff first?</p>
<p>I think I'll start with <em>reading the fucking manual</em>...</p>
<p>To be continued, I guess.</p>
