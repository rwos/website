<p>&quot;You are missing some linker flag somewhere&quot; translates to C++ as follows:</p>
<pre><code>undefined reference to
`OIS::InputManager::createInputSystem(std::multimap&lt;std::basic_string&lt;char,
std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;, std::basic_string&lt;char,
std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt;, std::less&lt;std::basic_string&lt;char,
std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt; &gt;,
std::allocator&lt;std::pair&lt;std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,
std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt; const, std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;,
std::allocator&lt;char&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;)'
</code></pre>
<p>There is no place in this world for a language like that.
We have enough problems already.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Using.</p>
<p>C++.</p>
<p>Use C, use Go, use a Lisp - heck, use C# or Java or Brainfuck. But
please, please, please stop that C++ bullshit.</p>
<p>Yes, it's only some linker flag. Yes, it works on your machine. Yes, if
I would use Visual Studio Highly Professional Gold Plate Edition 2012
IntelliSense with Service Pack 2a, I could just import the project file.
Yes, I only need to learn using your XML-based build tool and specify that
flag. Yes, that's only a problem with gcc after 4.23-123 and before
3.23-2, or on AMD-64 machines made around Christmas 2010, or on rainy
Tuesdays, or both. Yes, Gentoo has a patch for it. Yes, I'm a programmer,
yes I could fix it.</p>
<p>No, I'm not going to fix it. I'm not even going to report it. I'm sick
and tired of this shit. Big C++ Projects <em>never</em> manage to do a clean
compile out of the box. And virtually every C++ project is big. And
all of those C++ projects have a metric shitload of dependencies. And
more often than not, you have to have the right <em>minor</em> version or even
the right patch-level installed. And every fucking C++ project bigger
than &quot;hello world&quot; takes ages to compile. And what does it come back with?
Kilobytes of error messages.</p>
<p>No, Dear C++ programmers, you got that wrong. You see, the compiler is
normally used to generate <em>binaries</em>, not error messages.
Most languages don't even <em>have</em> an arbitrary-length error message
generator, like C++ does.</p>
<p>I'll tell you another secret: users make use of these binaries by <em>running</em> them.
And they make the lights in that plastic thing called <em>computer</em> go on and
off with a certain rhythm. And sometimes, there's even sound or network
activity! It's a magic world, the world of working programs, I tell you.</p>
<p>I will never try compiling a C++ project again.</p>
<p>I do realize that this is not very threatening, but you have to start
<em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>Just say no to C++.</p>
<p>Or NO.</p>
<p>Or NO OH MY GOD NO NOT EVEN OVER MY DEAD BODY.</p>
<p>End of nerd rage reached. Thank you.</p>
