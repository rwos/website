      <h1>Adventures with Newsqueak</h1>

      <p>I pushed Rob Pike's Newsqueak interpreter to
<a href="http://github.com/rwos/Newsqueak">my github page</a>.</p>
<p>This might seem (and largely is) a senseless thing to do,
as it is freely available on
<a href="http://herpolhode.com/rob/">Rob's (old) homepage</a>.
And unfortunately it looks a bit like me trying to take credit for his
work, which I really do not intend to do - so let me explain, why I did this.</p>
<p>Last week or so, I tried to build <code>squint</code> (that's the official name of
this marvelous piece of software) on a machine running Ubuntu 10.10,
which gave strange warnings about a gcc built-in being called with a wrong
type.</p>
<p>This seemed odd, given that the version I tried to build was explicitly
marked as the &quot;Linux&quot; version (which implies that using gcc is okay) and
not too old, either (2000, okay that's eleven years, but still).</p>
<p>When I tried to run some test program through the interpreter, it died
with a segmentation fault. Now, this was <em>really</em> odd. I hooked up
gdb and it seemed that it died on a strlen() call somewhere deep in
the lexer.</p>
<p>Now, it <em>is</em> pretty easy to write a sloppy C program that dies on a
strlen() - just handle it a char array without a terminating NUL byte
and off you go. But lexers are usually super-simple and, last but not least,
it was friggin' Rob Pike who wrote it.</p>
<p>Clearly, there was something very wrong. And probably <em>not</em> the code itself.</p>
<p>So I though to myself &quot;okay, let's debug this sometime, and upload the modern
version to github&quot; - thinking that gcc probably changed some default behavior
over the years and I just needed to add something to CFLAGS to make up for that.</p>
<p>Fast forward a week including an update to the latest Ubuntu,
<a href="http://blog.r-wos.org/2011/fuck-unity-fuck-gnome3-i-m-going-to-downgrade">a disgusted look</a>,
and a downgrade to 10.04 LTS (i.e. &quot;long term support&quot;).</p>
<p>I had some time on my hands and tried to tackle this <code>squint</code> thing again.</p>
<p>I typed <code>make all</code> - and, lo and behold, no warning, but one error. The error
was about some pretty strange <code>#include</code> for <code>sys/wait.h</code> but with an absolute path
instead of, well, <code>sys/wait.h</code>.</p>
<p>So I removed the statement - and everything, including running the test programs,
just worked. I thought &quot;cool, fixed it&quot; and uploaded it to github. Then I
realized that the value of that one-line &quot;fix&quot; is, well, not too high, actually...</p>
<p>So now it looks like I took some software from one place, did absolutely
nothing on it, and uploaded it to another place, but with my name added.
Not that anybody cares, but I just wanted to explain the whole story so I can
stop feeling bad about it.</p>
<p>What also helps is that Newsqueak is a pretty neat (and mostly forgotten)
language. It has, among other nice things, basically typed named-pipe
elements at the language level. And there's a language-level <code>select</code> for these things,
too. So that's pretty cool and powerful, while still easy to reason about.
But the real language overview will have to wait until the next post -
I have to really learn it, first. :)</p>
<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: Well, it was (and is) a problem with the code. Some of the plan9
libraries included with squint don't build for 64 bit targets (or well, they
<em>do</em> build, but they die at runtime). I thought it was dependent on the gcc
version, because I switched that and forgot that I switched to
a 32 bit CPU at the same time. Word-size depend bugs never occured to me before,
so this wasn't exactly my first though on what was going wrong.)</p>
