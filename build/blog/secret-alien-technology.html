<p>Recently some colleagues of mine started hacking some OpenGL stuff,
which somehow motivated me to also dive into that again. Knowing that
I won't be able to keep me motivated writing a whole game, I thought
I'll tinker a bit with terrain generation - a fairly easy way to do
something exciting.</p>
<p>Now, my colleagues use C++, a language I don't exactly like very much.
I could have just used C, but in my usual way of spending too much
time solving self-inflicted problems, I thought &quot;why not common lisp?&quot;.</p>
<img src="http://r-wos.org/media/lisplogo_warning_128.png">
<p>Well, I'll tell you why not.</p>
<p>I spent the last two days getting a common lisp implementation to run
some toy OpenGL example. Not the whole two days, mind you - but still
much too much time.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>make</code>, lisp apparently uses something called <code>asdf</code> (pro:
very easy to type). Somehow, I missinterpreted what <code>asdf</code> does -
I though it was some kind of package system, but it's &quot;only&quot; a
dependency-resolving build tool. So, in my ignorance, I downloaded the
lisp OpenGL binding packages in the hope they'd include documentation
describing how to get them installed so that <code>asdf</code> finds them. Well,
that didn't work out too well - the cl-opengl package comes with exactly
zero install documentation. Great - off to <code>asdf</code>'s manual.</p>
<p>That manual describes quite well where to place the package, and how to
load it. The only problem is that cl-opengl in turn has quite some
dependencies.
And downloading them all manually can't be the right way to do things.
Besides, my <code>asdf</code> installation was a bit too old - and the new version
changed the api for loading packages, of all things. Great, volume two.</p>
<p>Now, one <em>can</em> install/load the newer version using the old version -
but I couldn't figure out how to tell my lisp implementation (I use
sbcl, by the way) to always use the newer one. Besides, I grew really
tired of the whole process. This began to look like system administration</p>
<ul>
<li>fiddling with configuration files, adding paths in startup files...
I hate that kind of thing, with a passion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next day, after some googling, I found a thing called <code>quicklisp</code>
which <em>is</em> a package system. Like, a real one! Success!</p>
<p>Quicklisp was like a breath of fresh air - friendly, telling
you exactly what you need to do - and everything just worked. I got
the OpenGL, Glut and Glu bindings installed, loaded the aforementioned
example program - and there were colorful rotating pyramids! And
music filled the air, and there were people dancing on the streets.</p>
<p>One remaining problem is that I don't know how one would distribute a
common lisp program in source form. Can I just assume everybody uses
quicklisp? That doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>On a side note: I'm really underwhelmed by the state of lisp programming
tools - it's 2012 and some Emacs mode is the absolute height of
lisp programming? A REPL on steroids, with &quot;online documentation&quot;. Wow.
That's the superiority of lisp, something nearly as useful as Eclipse?
They must be kidding. I really hope there's something better out there
I just haven't found yet.</p>
<p>Also, the program startup takes ages (3 seconds or so, where it should take
a fraction of a second), but that's probably my fault. Everything <em>should</em>
get compiled to machine code, but it seems like the external packages
are loaded from source every time. Is there something like static linking
in the lisp world? Who knows.</p>
<p>Well, I don't. Everything seems so alien to me. There's a whole lot of
manuals waiting to be read, I guess.</p>
