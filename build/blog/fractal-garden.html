<p>Some more Processing stuff:</p>
<p><a href="http://r-wos.org/processing/fractal_garden/index.html">Fractal Garden</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-System</a> viewer. It's nothing fancy, I just wanted to have some base system to play around with fractals.</p>
<p>In other news: I'm still fighting with the trigonometry needed for my side-scrolling air plane game. Still tuning parameters and debugging the aerodynamic lift. I really should have based the physics simulation on real values from real planes...</p>
<p>In even other news: I've been playing around with Python lately. What a great language! I have to write about that some time.</p>
