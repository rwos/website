<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design:
One way is to make it so simple that there are <em>obviously</em>
no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated
that there are no <em>obvious</em> deficiencies.</p>
<p>The first method is far more difficult.</p>
<p><small>C.A.R. Hoare</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Android is not a developer-friendly system.</p>
<p>Starting with development for Android first of all means downloading. Downloading gigabytes of SDKs, libraries, documentation, editors, plugins for those editors, emulators, system images, cross-assemblers, tools, cowbells, lol-cat gifs, old Time magazine issues, and gigs and gigs and gigs of what is mainly: <em>stuff</em>.</p>
<p>Then, when the intertubes are empty, and you hard drive is full, you can start. Start Eclipse.</p>
<p>Yes, it's possible to code Android apps with other editors. I've even heard of people who know <em>how</em> to do it - just tweak those ant-files, add this patch, and then enter these 23 friendly commands.</p>
<p>So, Eclipse it is then.</p>
<p>(How, just how, can they force programmers into this environment? Do they know nothing about Unix? It's Android for heaven's sake, it's a Linux kernel underneath, and the development environment looks like one made for Windows CE. Why is there no fucking C compiler and a Makefile? They could have wrapped this Eclipse pile-of-shit around the compiler and the Makefile, so that sane people can work in a sane environment and idiots can &quot;refactor&quot;. What was the fucking problem? Anyway, back to the text.)</p>
<p>As is commonly known, Eclipse is made by people who (a) cannot type, (b) cannot program, (c) have no taste whatsoever, (d) have never seen a programmer doing her job, and (e) are blind. These are pretty hard requirements, so they have some problems getting contributors, I guess. Maybe they even let some people in who <em>can</em> program, and just have no taste. I'm not sure. Anyway, they somehow managed to assemble a huge <em>development environment</em>, whatever that is.</p>
<p>It has all the features of a good operating system, but in a slower and often-crashing version. It's like a pun on operating systems. The window manager, for instance, is a complete joke. As is the global search. As is the editor.</p>
<p>So this is the developer's window to the Android world. It's broken.</p>
<p>And then you're in and the pain goes on and on and on. Every fucking thing in this fucking Android world is either an XML file, a relational database, or an object. It's a constant struggle against the compiler, against access control bullshit, constant re-configuration and re-compilation. I wonder how they ever managed to do one single working program with this unneeded complexity everywhere.</p>
<p>Oh, right, they didn't.</p>
<p>And Java is <em>not</em> helpful. It's a nice thing that it's garbage-collected, but that is about it. Everything must be written at least thrice to satisfy this programmer-distrusting, second-thinking piece-of-shit which is the Java compiler.</p>
<p>Why do I have to write &quot;public&quot; fucking <em>everywhere</em>? Really, <code>public class</code> - is this some kind of joke, or what? It's a <em>class</em>, <em>of-jesus-fucking-course</em> I want it to be public, I want to <em>use</em> it you morons! They didn't even make public the default for when there is no visibility specifier (which is allowed, yes, but then that class has only package-wide visibility - well, thanks a lot). The whole access and visibility issue in Java is completely out of control.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much, a little &quot;public&quot; here, a little &quot;public&quot; there - but the whole algorithm, everything the program <em>does</em> gets completely lost between all this forced noise bullshit coming from the language. Everything ends up getting delegated and overridden until someone comes and &quot;refactors&quot; and the bullshit-cycle starts anew.</p>
<p>Java is near to unusable. Yes, Python spoiled me. But even C is cleaner, <em>including</em> the manual memory management.</p>
<p>Somehow, I managed to hack together something nearly working. I have a menu and an options screen and managed to draw onto a canvas. Which is nice. But it really wasn't fun.</p>
<p>Although it could be.</p>
<p>Although it fucking should be.</p>
