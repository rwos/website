<p>That one was surprisingly easy, then hard, and eventually pretty easy
again.</p>
<p>In most GUI-frameworks, I think, one could have just used the normal
text-on-canvas functions to draw some text on top of the OpenGL
canvas. At least that's what I had expected.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't really work that way in Racket's GUI framework.
So, text rendering in OpenGL it is.</p>
<p>Some googling later, I was horrified - the way one renders text in
OpenGL is basically the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtaining a bitmap of the text</li>
<li>converting that to a texture</li>
<li>mapping that texture onto an object</li>
<li>rendering the object</li>
</ul>
<p>But I figured I had no choice. Off to Racket's documentation (which
is excellent, by the way) for point one on the list: obtaining a
bitmap with text on it.</p>
<p>That's <em>really</em> easy in racket:</p>
<pre><code>(let* ([text-target (make-bitmap 200 200)]
       [dc (new bitmap-dc% [bitmap text-target])])
  (send dc draw-text &quot;hello, world!&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>All right, now - how can I convert that to an OpenGL texture?
Turns out, I don't have to. There's a handy function which
directly converts that bitmap into an OpenGL display-list -
ready for rendering.</p>
<pre><code>(gl-call-list (bitmap-&gt;gl-list text-target))
</code></pre>
<p>So, at the end of the day, that was quite easy. It's not perfect (the
letters look pretty bad and turning on font-smoothing only makes it
worse) but good enough for now. And there's an up-side:
the text-holding object behaves like any other 3D object in the scene,
now. It can be textured, reacts to the scene's lightening, etc.</p>

because it was easy to do.)</p>
