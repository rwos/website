      <h1>Planets! Yay!</h1>
      <p><b><time datetime="2012-04-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000">2012-04-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000</time></b></p>
      <p>I just got my little terrain generator to render the first planets.</p>
<p>The generated terrain is not yet very realistic, the &quot;texture&quot; is just
a height-map and the poles (not pictured) look <em>really</em> bad.</p>
<p>Still: success! I managed to get something involving sine and cosine
to actually work, sort of. And I regained my sixth grade math skills in
the process...</p>

<p>It's written in <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, which
is a Scheme, which is a Lisp - which doesn't matter since I have yet to
find OpenGL bindings that would not follow that strange standard OpenGL
programming style.</p>
<p>However, there are three advantages in using a Lisp over something
like C: <code>read</code>, <code>eval</code>, and <code>print</code>.</p>
<p>I've build a console into the generator's main window, which exposes
an interactive read-eval-print-loop to the user. It's not yet hooked up
to the generator's internals but evaluating standard Racket code does
work:</p>

<p>(By the way - that sort of thing is not complicated in Racket. About
twenty lines of code, including the text-field instantiation.)</p>
<p>When that console is done, debugging and further development can happen
interactively - with a live preview, as it were.</p>
