      <p>I like reading source code but it's hard to find suggestions for programs that
make a good read. There are some lists floating around the web, but it's always
the same four or five projects - sqlite, xmonad, and so on. And it seemed to
me that most people blurting out &quot;sqlite&quot; didn't really <em>read</em> it.</p>
<p>Well, I thought, one way to get informed suggestions for programs
to read would be to create a community of people who read programs.</p>
<p>So I created <a href="http://reddit.com/r/listing">/r/listing</a>, and announced
it on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a>, and...</p>
<p>...it bombed. Completely. 5 upvotes, 5 downvotes. I knew that it wouldn't
exactly attract millions of people, but I also didn't expect it to do <em>that</em>
bad.</p>
<p>But it's not the end of the world. We do have 6 subscribers, mind you. It will
be a slower growth than I anticipated but maybe that's actually a good thing.</p>
<p>The current suggestions for programs to read are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://git.suckless.org/st/tree/">st - a simple X11 terminal emulator</a> (I posted that)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lua.org/source/5.2/">lua - the programming language interpreter</a> (I posted that one, too)</li>
</ul>
<p>aaaaaand - *drum roll*</p>
<p><a href="http://code.haskell.org/xmonad/">xmonad</a>.</p>
<p>Well, what can I say - it's a start.</p>
