<p>Did I mention that <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> is fun?</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://r-wos.org/processing/fractal_garden_2/index.html">Fractal Garden Version 2</a> - this combines three things:</p>
<p>First of all, it's a Conway's Game of Life Simulation on the left hand side. Initialising a population is done via &quot;drawing&quot; in that part of the applet.</p>
<p>This Game of Life however, is not binary (dead/alive), but features symbols - namely F, +, -, [, and ] - and a &quot;dead&quot;-status.</p>
<p>The symbols (i.e. the living population of the Game) compose some kind of source code for a fractal drawing routine. The fractal representation of the code is shown on the left.</p>
<p>That may sound pretty complicated, but is actually super-simple (check out the source!).</p>
<p>And it's pretty nice to look at. Does anybody need some Hollywood-style AI display? :)</p>

PS: Processing is fun!
<p>Update: Whoops, I just found two bugs in it. The program works because these bugs are cancelling each other out:</p>
<p>Bug #1: My rand_sym() routine never returns the closing bracket ']'.</p>
<p>Bug #2: The balance() routine does the wrong thing when there are more closing than opening brackets. It appends opening brackets, but it should prepend them.</p>
<p>Well, so, whatever. It's art and not an accounting program. I'll just leave it that way.</p>
<p>Update #2: Doing The Right Thingâ„¢ makes the fractals much smaller and less cool looking. So, these bugs shall now be named &quot;features&quot;. And everyone lived happily ever after.</p>
