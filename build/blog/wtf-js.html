<p>Playing with node.js currently, and I don't grok it. I'm passable (not &quot;good&quot;,
just passable) in JavaScript but I don't get why anyone would ever want
to program in the style node.js dictates.</p>
<p>It's async, yeah. <em>Only</em> async. And async without language-level promises, or
channels, or a <code>select</code>. Or multi-processing. Or anything really. They basically write in
continuation passing style. In one thread. By hand. And it wouldn't completely
surprise me if they chiseled it in stone and OCR'd it back.</p>
<p>If you are going backwards, you might as well go all the way.</p>
<p>Let's make two HTTP requests, shall we?</p>
<pre><code>var result_1, result 2;
http.get(&quot;http://one.com&quot;,
  function(response) {
    response.on('data',
      function(data) {
        result_1 = data;
        http.get(&quot;http://two.com&quot;,
          function(response) {
            response.on('data',
              function(data) {
                result_2 = data;
                // do stuff with the results
              }
            );
          }
        );
      }
    );
  }
);
</code></pre>
<p>The fuck? Now, there are libraries that transform that pyramid of
callbacks into a single one - but that's just a cosmetic change. It's
still a series of callbacks. And - as far as I understand - there is
no <code>force(promise)</code> - in other words, no way to sync.</p>
<p>Why don't they just do it synchronously? Why is there no blocking
API? I don't get it.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't have anything to do with performance.
If I want the two requests to succeed before going on, I'll have to
wait for them - in both async and synchronous style.</p>
<p>The only thing that that async fuck-up buys me is that I now have
a bunch of needlessly nested scopes.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I don't get it?</p>
<p>Sure, <em>sometimes</em> it's quite nice to do stuff asynchronously.
Maybe it's even a good idea to make non-blocking the default.
But <em>only</em> non-blocking APIs?</p>
<p>Did I mention that...</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I think I did.</p>
