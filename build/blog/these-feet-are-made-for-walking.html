<p>I just finished a part of <strike>the terrain-generator</strike>
...well, let's call it &quot;the OpenGL project&quot;
that generates some three-dimensional primitives.</p>
<p>I think the internal API is quite nice - though, admittedly I may be
a bit biased... :-)</p>
<p>If one wanted a sphere (there is no choice, really - spheres are the
only primitives implemented for now) at some point (1,2,3) in space,
it's:</p>
<pre><code>(at 1 2 3
    (sphere))
</code></pre>
<p>That sphere has a radius of one unit - a sphere with half of that
size would be:</p>
<pre><code>(at 1 2 3
  (scaled 0.5
    (sphere)))
</code></pre>
<p>Two spheres with that 0.5 unit radius could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>(scaled 0.5
  (at 1 2 3 (sphere))
  (at 4 5 6 (sphere)))
</code></pre>
<p>and so on. Quite simple. These functions return lists (well, actually
trees) and those lists can then be passed to a render function.</p>
<p>I'm quite happy with that part of the code looking clean and nice again</p>
<ul>
<li>the mindless hacking and testing of the past two weeks began to take
its toll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshot number one (two spheres, obviously):</p>

<p>And screenshot number two:</p>

<p>The feet are only made of scaled and rotated spheres (per-axis scaling,
obviously). Once I had one foot defined, the whole high-level rendering code
looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>(render
  (at  1 0 -5 foot)
  (at -1 0 -5 (mirrored/x foot)))
</code></pre>
<p>Which, I think, looks quite elegant - and the outcome is better than I
thought. I just want to avoid doing manual 3D mesh modeling.</p>
<p>You might have also noticed some diffuse light - I switched the standard
OpenGL lighting on now. Better lighting and materials are the next point on
the TODO list.</p>
