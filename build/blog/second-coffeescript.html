      <p>Here's a small raycaster in CoffeeScript. I wrote that just to see how it
would look. (There's also a small rant at the end, if that's what you're
looking for.)</p>

<p>Not bad, certainly more succinct than JavaScript, but ...well - maybe I've been
writing too much Scheme lately but I've grown to <em>like</em> having parentheses
around everything. Making most of the nesting implicit may <em>look</em> cleaner,
but it feels so brittle to me. One basically relies on operator precedence,
and - somehow - that's making me uncomfortable. (To be fair - I could
have included much more parentheses in the above code, I just thought
I'd try and go full-on crazy with CoffeeScript's syntax).</p>
<p>But the biggest problem I have with these significant-whitespace and
implicit-nesting languages is that they don't go far enough: If I was to write
something like</p>
<pre><code> foo = bar x,y
       * factor
</code></pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre><code>foo = bar x,y  * factor
</code></pre>
<p>a human reader would probably assume it means</p>
<pre><code>foo = bar(x,y) * factor
</code></pre>
<p>But CoffeeScript parses the second one as</p>
<pre><code>foo = bar(x,y*factor)
</code></pre>
<p>and errors-out on the first one. In the same vein,
this works in CoffeeScript:</p>
<pre><code>coffee&gt; (x for x in [0..3] when x != 2)
[ 0, 1, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>But this doesn't:</p>
<pre><code>coffee&gt; (x for x in [0..3] unless x == 2)
[ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
</code></pre>
<p>even though <code>unless</code> is a keyword and behaves as one would expect in most other cases.</p>
<pre><code>coffee&gt; x = 1 unless true is false
1
</code></pre>
<p>I mean, one <em>can</em> go down the <strike>highway to hell</strike> road of &quot;code
that looks like English sentences&quot;, but one has to go all the way, with a real
natural language parser.  But what all of these languages - including
CoffeeScript - do is rename &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; to &quot;and&quot; and replace some other symbols with
&quot;then&quot; and &quot;when&quot;. So now stuff looks like English but behaves like code -
including strange parse errors. How does that help anyone?</p>
<p>That's what I meant when I said &quot;90% design&quot; in the last post - it just doesn't fucking
work <em>all</em> of the time, and that's frustrating. One man's &quot;why would you do <em>that</em>?&quot; is another
man's &quot;basic usage&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1 if true      # works

if true x = 1      # doesn't

if true then x = 1 # works

if true then       # doesn't work
    x = 1          # (parse error)
    
if true then       # &quot;works&quot;
x = 1              # (always sets x to 1)

if true            #
    x = 1          # works

if true and true   #
    x = 1          # works

if true            #
and true           # doesn't work
    x = 1          # (parse error)

if true            #
   and true        # doesn't work
    x = 1          # (different parse error)

if true and        #
   true            #
    x = 1          # works

if true and        #
    true           #
    x = 1          # doesn't (!)

if true and        #
     true          #
    x = 1          # works (!!!!!)
</code></pre>
<p>Python would have the same problem, if it wasn't for the fact
that stuff in parentheses is free-form there - but no such luxury in
CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>Still, all-in-all I find CoffeeScript rather nice - it has quite a law-and-order
syntax but the execution model is unchanged from JavaScript (i.e. nice and
free). Simple things - that is, &quot;real-world code&quot; - seem to look better in
CoffeeScript. And (big plus) it compiles into straight-forward, readable
JavaScript.</p>
<p>It does leave many of JavaScript's warts unfixed (I assume this is by design),
but yeah, at least everything is an expression now and the scope behaves as it
should.</p>
