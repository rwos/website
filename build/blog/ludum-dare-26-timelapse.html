<p>The 26th <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a> game programming
competition was this weekend. The theme was &quot;minimalism&quot;.</p>
<p>I wrote a game called &quot;::.::::::.&quot;. It can be played <a href="http://r-wos.org/hacks/ld26/">over
here</a> (use Chrome
if you can).</p>
<p>I don't have a post-mortem handy (this time around, I'll wait with that until
the ratings are in) but the timelapse has just finished uploading:</p>

<p>It was a whole lot of fun, as always. And now I have to play-test and
rate the little over 1000 games the others wrote.</p>
<p>Excuse me for a moment - I have work to do.  :-)</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: The postmortem is <a href="http://r-wos.org/blog/ludum-dare-26-postmortem">here</a>)</p>
