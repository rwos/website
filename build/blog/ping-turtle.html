<p>This is a graph of the <code>ping</code> responses of the <code>www</code> sub-domain of all 2-char
DNS names for <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, and <code>.net</code> (i.e. <a href="http://www.aa.com">www.aa.com</a>, <a href="http://www.ab.com">www.ab.com</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>The color and angle of each line is a function of the IP-address, the length
is proportional to the response time.</p>

<p>That's a very important graph of course, highly relevant to basically
everything. I know. It's not too pretty, though.</p>
<p>That's why I'm currently &quot;working&quot; (can't call that work, really) on a graph
showing <code>tracemap</code> output, that's more interesting. I want it to look like a
city map - and you'd thought that rendering a bunch of edges and nodes to
look like a map is a solved problem, but you'd be wrong. I tried to
beat <code>grapviz</code> into submission, to no avail. Seems like <code>graphviz</code> can only
do ugly stuff.</p>
<p>So now I'm in the midst of writing my own graph layout engine. How did I
get here? How come that every time one tries to do something half-way
interesting in code one runs into the deepest math tar pits? One minute,
programming is like playing with LEGOs - and before you know it you find
yourself in a situation where you would have to disprove the Halting Problem
and de-construct and re-assemble the universe in order for your approach to
work. Computers are strange.</p>
<p>Fun, but strange.</p>
