<p>The next <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> is very very soon. That means it's
time to think about games, again.</p>
<p>First: the platform of choice: I've actually been pretty happy with what I
chose last time - JavaScript and the usual 2D-Canvas stuff. It was fast to program
in, performed well enough and worked on every platform. So, I'm absolutely sure
I'll be using JavaScript again - though maybe I won't directly write in it,
this time around.</p>
<p>One possibility would be to use <a href="http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/">Whalesong</a>,
a Racket-to-JavaScript compiler thing. I don't have any illusions - writing the
whole thing in Racket won't make me code any faster, or the game any better.
But it would be a nice challenge, I think. Could be fun.</p>
<p>The other idea that came to me just yesterday was to use some
JavaScript implementation of a machine or something. Like, writing the whole
thing in C64-BASIC and letting it run on a JavaScript C64 emulator.  Or in C
and letting it run on a JavaScript Linux VM.  That would be even cooler than
writing it in Racket - but it does introduce quite a lot of problems. The
biggest of which will probably be the really, really bad performance of the
whole thing. Well, we'll see.</p>
<p>For the game's engine, I'm currently playing around with various software
rendering stuff - I have a ...well, a thing ...one could call it a stochastic
ray-caster. It produces very nice low-tech, pseudo-retro kind of
effects.</p>
<img src="http://r-wos.org/media/rand-raycast.png" style="max-width:100%">
<p>I really do like software renderers. I'm not very good at writing them (too bad
at math), but I do like just how much crazy stuff you can do with a software
renderer that would be hard or impossible to do with the usual
hardware-accelerated 3D-APIs.</p>
<p>For the game's content - well, let's wait for the official theme announcement,
shall we?</p>
<p>This Ludum Dare, I won't have the whole weekend for coding. But if my last
attendance is any indication, time won't be too big of a problem.</p>
<p>...well, no actually, I got that wrong. Time will be <em>the</em> biggest problem
of them all.</p>
<p>In other news: work is currently <em>exceptionally</em> boring. I really enjoy
programming, like <em>really</em> - but the things I'm currently forced to
do at work, and the context I'm doing them in, are killing all the fun.</p>
<p>So, by way of variety, I've done something completely pointless: I've
integrated a Scheme interpreter into <a href="http://r-wos.org/about">my about page</a>.
It really works! If you don't know Scheme try <code>(+ 40 2)</code> or
<code>((lambda (x) (* x x)) 12)</code> for a start.</p>
<p>It's the little things in life... :-)</p>
