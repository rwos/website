<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This is a rage - and, as rages typically go, it doesn't contain any information beside &quot;I am frustrated and stuff doesn't work&quot;. I'll leave it here (it's the only page on this site that gets stable non-zero traffic) - but please continue at your own peril. Also, I'm normally a calm and friendly person. Just so you know. (Oh, and I ended
up using Xfce on a Debian system.)</p>

<p>Today I tried to connect a monitor to a netbook running Ubuntu 11.10. It was a farce.</p>
<p>The netbook recognized the monitor.</p>
<p>That's the <em>only</em> thing that worked. To be precise: that's the only thing these &quot;designer&quot; fucktards have not managed to break over the latest Ubuntu releases.</p>
<p>And boy, did they break a lot. First of all, &quot;Unity&quot;, Ubuntu's new buggy desktop environment, cannot handle multiple monitors with different resolutions. It just can't. They never even thought of the possibility. Because everything in this pile of crap is &quot;designed&quot; to fill the complete screen, everything looks very, very, <em>very</em> bad if there isn't one single complete screen.</p>
<p>The application-launch-panel joke-thingy on the left adjusts itself to a completely arbitrary length, displaying some pathetic &quot;more applications&quot; symbol on what it thinks is the bottom of the screen. This is idiotic in normal operation - and it gets truly moronic when the calculated (or guessed?) &quot;bottom of the screen&quot; is actually the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>Second, you cannot decide on which screen you want this panel to be. That would be too much complexity, I guess. Yeah, better leave that preference setting out.</p>
<p>But - there was hope. Xubuntu, the xfce version, delivering the good things of Ubuntu without the Children's-Playground-GUI side since 2010. And they fucked that up, too.</p>
<p>You know, it was a netbook. And because, over in designer-land, a netbook is somehow not a real computer, and because it's so small, <em>every fucking single window gets maximized by default</em>. What the fucking fuck fuck were they thinking?</p>
<p>Oh, I know, just switch the auto-maximization off in the preferences panel!</p>
<p>Hahaha. Of course, <em>there is no fucking preference</em> for this absolutely moronic decision. Its built-in. Live with it.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair - it <em>is</em> possible to switch this and most other idiotic things off. Just open &quot;gconf-editor&quot; and edit the setting under /apps/whatever/dontcare/this/is/worse/than/the/windows/registry.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing. In a deep, fundamental way.</p>
<p>You, ladies and gentlemen, all of you working on Unity and on GNOME3, designing the &quot;user experience&quot; to meet some wet dream you once had, about linux on some touch device - you kill the linux desktop. Right now. And every fucking day.</p>
<p>I used to recommend Ubuntu to everyone. As a faster, more stable, more secure operating system. Without much to learn, or to adjust, if you're switching from Windows. Firefox is there, Thunderbird is there. It's just faster. The sun shines.</p>
<p>I cannot do that anymore. I can't, for the love of god, recommend anyone to switch from a <em>stable</em> Windows 7 desktop to the <em>highly unstable</em>, bug ridden joke that is the Unity or GNOME3 desktop.</p>
<p>And I won't.</p>
<p>I'm going to downgrade. I'm going to install <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/">Ubuntu 9.10</a>.</p>
<p>Because that one had a desktop. One that doesn't change every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Play your teenage games without me, fuckers.</p>
