<p>Apparently, recruiting spammers are making progress - they now have a
perl script that parses github user profiles:</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Notice your github online.. (was trying to understand the <code>my_brain_hurts</code>
repositories)</p>
<p>A contact of mine founded trustyou.com in Munich, it's a datamining
platform and they partner with businesses like tripadvisor. At the
moment they are looking for a front end web applications engineer as
well as python backend engineer.. not sure if you are aware of anyone in
the community who could be up for a challenge (down in Munich)?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your thoughts J</p>

<p>Here are the entire contents of the repo that they have problems to understand:</p>
<pre><code>from os import*
r='s=[0]*8**5'
p=0
for c in read(0,9**9):r+='\n'+' '*p+dict(zip(&quot;&gt;&lt;+-.,[&quot;,&quot;p+=1|p-=1|s[p]+=1|s[p]-=1|write(1,chr(s[p]))|s[p]=ord(read(0,1))|while s[p]:&quot;.split('|'))).get(c,'');p+=c in'[]'and 92-ord(c)
exec r
</code></pre>
<p>And who could blame them? It's not exactly pretty code. It's also not very
interesting - it's a brainfuck interpreter. It first translates brainfuck into
python (in the long line, the result of the <code>dict</code> call is a mapping between
brainfuck (first argument to <code>zip</code>) and python (the rest)). The value of
<code>p</code> is used for indentation. The last line executes the resulting python
program.</p>
<p>So much for the explanation - and since they asked for my thoughts, here are my
thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're going to parse github, don't just take the first repo in $language
or you'll end up writing to people about their dotfile repos.</li>
<li>Use a spell checker on your mail template.</li>
<li>Don't put &quot;This e-mail contains proprietary information some or all of which
may be legally privileged. It is for the intended recipient only.&quot; into your
disclaimer. It won't help, people will just ignore it. Oops, I think I just
did. Sorry.</li>
<li>Use a spell checker on your mail template. Seriously.</li>
<li>The whole concept of recruiting spam doesn't make sense to me. You're
basically recruiting people that are stupid enough to reply to spam.
Or do you use those mails as a honeypot and blacklist everyone that
replies? That would make more sense.</li>
<li>Use a spell checker on your mail template. And use <em>one</em> dot at the end
of every sentence.</li>
<li>Oh, and about the python engineer in Munich? No idea.</li>
</ul>
