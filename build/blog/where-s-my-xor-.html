<p>Apparently the kids today don't do XOR any more.</p>
<p>My natural approach on graphically drawing things to the screen would be XORing some Bitmap with the screen. Then another XOR on the same position would &quot;delete&quot; that. After that I would XOR the Bitmap again, on a new position. Which - tada - results in an animated sequence.</p>
<p>Problem is: SDL doesn't have any &quot;XOR this with that&quot; primitive. Or I just can't find it. And - at least this is what Google spits out on the topic - it's apparently okay to do a whole screen erase and redraw for every single frame.</p>
<p>Seems a bit resource-wasting to me, but I'll try that and see how it works out. It sure would simplify some things. And I can imagine modern machines to be fast enough to do this at 40 frames per second. Still, I'm a bit worried whether the 400Mhz MIPS CPU in the NanoNote can handle it.</p>
<p>Well, there's my old problem again: too much thinking, too little coding. I just cannot stand bad solutions - not in my own code, at least.</p>
<p>Gotta work on that, when I think about it...</p>
