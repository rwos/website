      <p>I'm currently in the process of going through all the source code on my
machine, trying to sort it. It's funny <em>how</em> much of unfinished, buggy,
segfaulting stuff accumulates over the years.</p>
<p>Now, I could just go and delete all that code, I'm not going to touch it
anymore, anyway. But - well, I can't.</p>
<p>And since this is 2012 and there's unlimited space in <em>the cloud</em>, I just
opened a <a href="https://github.com/rwos/scrapyard">scrapyard repository
on github</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not just dumping any old files in there - I <em>do</em> make sure things compile
and run (most of the time) and I'm writing a small README for each project.</p>
<p>For now, I've uploaded an attempt at constructing an artificial intelligence
from brainfuck programs. That, maybe not surprisingly, turned out to be a
spectacularly bad idea. I've
<a href="http://blog.r-wos.org/2011/artificial-stupidity">written about that
some time ago</a>.</p>
<p>And I've uploaded what is basically a graphical compiler-error-message
viewer. It shows compiler error messages translated into pretty (well, not
<em>pretty</em>) animations. It's an idea with a great future (NOT). If anybody wants
to continue working on it - you can now go ahead and make your dreams come
true (<em>no no no no no</em>).
Here's a screenshot:</p>

<p>All in all, this repository is not - and will never be - of any value to
anybody. And no users means no bugs, right?</p>
<p>And I can sleep well, knowing that my little hacks now live save from
any danger, triple-replicated and 24/7 monitored on some US hard drives.</p>
