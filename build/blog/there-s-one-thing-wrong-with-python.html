<p>Finally! I found something that is wrong with Python!
<small>With Python2, that is - Python3 saves itself from being wrong
by being stupid.</small></p>
<p>And it's really wrong, it's of &quot;absolutely broken&quot; wrongness.
On a scale from 0 (right) to 12 (wrong) this would score a straight
twenty-seven.</p>
<p>It's about scope in nested functions.</p>
<p>Normally, scope in python is pretty straight-forward. Okay, to access
the global scope from a non-global scope, one has to use the <code>global</code>
keyword:</p>
<pre><code>foo = 0
def bar():
    global foo # no access to foo without this
    print foo
</code></pre>
<p>That's stupid but it doesn't really qualify as being wrong.
Now enter nested functions:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    state = 1
    def bar():
        pass # &quot;pass&quot; is a no-op
    bar()
    return state
print foo()
</code></pre>
<p>That's the (artifical) example I'll be using. It doesn't do something
useful and the nested function is not needed here, but that's not
the point. I &quot;discovered&quot; the behaviour I'm going to describe while writing
a lexer. Which <em>did</em> do something useful. Or at least it would have - if
python had let it.</p>
<p>So, the program above is perfectly valid python and prints <code>1</code>, as you
would expect.</p>
<p>This, on the other hand, is <em>not</em> valid python:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    state = 1
    def bar():
        state += 1
    bar()
    return state
print foo() # should print 2, but doesn't
</code></pre>
<p>It gives an <code>UnboundLocalError</code>: &quot;local variable 'state' referenced
before assignment&quot;.</p>
<p>The unhelpful error message notwithstanding, that seems to be the
same case as with global variables. Seems like we always have to
be explicit to access higher-than-local scope.</p>
<p>Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, that might have been the thought behind it.</p>
<p>No, <code>global</code> doesn't work in this case - and there is no complement for
use in functions. <small>I'm told that python 3 has <code>nonlocal</code> which solves
this issue - but again: I think that requiring that explicitness is just
stupid.</small></p>
<p>But wait, there's more! We were wrong about the need to be explicit:
in fact, <code>bar()</code> <em>does</em> have access to <code>state</code> - by default! How come?</p>
<p>Well, local functions can <em>access</em> all variables local to their parent
function. They just can't rebind them.</p>
<p>To see how utterly, utterly wrong this is, take a look at the following
code. Which does <em>exactly</em> what the last snipped intended to do, but is
absolutely legal python. Because this time, we cheat our ways around that
idiotic &quot;no rebind&quot; policy:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    state = [1]
    def bar():
        state[0] += 1
    bar()
    return state[0]
print foo() # prints 2
</code></pre>
<p>Really, are you kidding me or what? How can &quot;access, but not rebind&quot; ever
have seemed to be a good idea? I sincerly hope that this behaviour is only
due to some implementation detail and fell out for free.</p>
<p>Because I just cannot imagine anyone being stupid enough to implement this
deliberately.</p>
<p>Ironically, this is also legal:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    global state
    state = 1
    def bar():
        global state
        state += 1
    bar()
    return state
print foo() # prints 2
</code></pre>
<p>Great, your scope-access control bullshit allows introducing global variables
that <em>nobody knows about</em> because they are not declared anywhere in the global
scope - but it doesn't allow nested functions to access perfectly encapsulated
<em>local</em> variables of their parents. Gnah!</p>
<p>But let's explore this some more: solely accessing <code>state</code> in <code>bar()</code> is allowed -
which, for instance, makes the following legal python:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    state = 1
    def bar():
        print state # prints 1
    bar()
    return state
print foo() # prints 1
</code></pre>
<p>That was expected. What was unexpected: this is also legal:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    state = 1
    def bar():
        state = 2
    bar()
    return state
print foo() # prints 1 [sic!]
</code></pre>
<p>That's because in this case the <code>state</code> that <code>bar()</code> sets to <code>2</code> is a
<em>different</em> <code>state</code> than the one in <code>foo()</code>. No Error, everything is
fine. How... why... I don't even... ARG!</p>
<p>But I'm not mad. There's one thing horribly wrong with Python.</p>
<p>That's pretty good for a programming language, I'd say.</p>
