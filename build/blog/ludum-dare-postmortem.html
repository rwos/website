      <p>The following is a copy of the short postmortem I wrote for the
<a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> website. I just want to archive it here as I hate dead links and don't trust anybodies WordPress installations to be still available some years down the road.</p>
<p>It may or may not be helpful for you if you plan to attend the next Ludum Dare - which you <em>must</em> absolutely do, it's a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Here's the screencast of the whole thing:</p>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MG53Fm-JHBU" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<hr>
<p>This was my first Ludum Dare and I made a game called
&quot;<a href="http://r-wos.org/hacks/ld24/ld24">Moore's Game</a>&quot;. It's basically a journey through the evolution of video games – starting with Tic Tac Toe on a line-printer and ending with a ray-casting first person shooter.</p>
<p>Technology-wise it's written in JavaScript, using the 2d-context of the HTML5 canvas element.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-right">What went right</h2>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> - apart from the few times where I got stuck (more on that later), I was working pretty fast. Pong, Breakout and the raytracer for the Wolf3D-like level were done really quickly. It helped that I disregarded every coding best practice in existence. Even though faking namespaces via objects or closures is possible and common in Javascript, I didn't do that and just put everything into the global namespace. That made for messy code (more on that later) but speedy development.</p>
<p>Although I (think I) was fast, I couldn't finish everything I had originally planned. More on that later (that's going to be a big what-went-wrong section, oh my...).</p>
<p><strong>Technology choice</strong> - Modern Javascript interpreters (read: browsers) are blazingly fast, given the (security-)constraints in which they have to operate. The canvas API is simple and straight-forward. And the result is playable on every operating system with a modern browser.  What's not to like about that? Javascript as a language has it's share of problems, but it's not too bad. It has really just the wrong syntax for the dynamic, lisp-like language it actually is.</p>
<p><strong>The competition</strong> - as I said, this was my first Ludum Dare. I had the most programming-related fun since …ever, really! :-) I also didn't expect such a cool community. I was on the IRC a little bit, during the competition, and I was stunned how friendly and civilized everyone behaved. It's the internet, people, you are expected to endlessly insult each other!</p>
<p>No, Ludum Dare is just great – it won't be my last one!</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong</h2>
<p><strong>Scope</strong> - that was my biggest problem. I just planned too much features. And while implementing those I had ideas for even more and more and more… I originally wanted to blend the gameplay from one game-generation into the other (that is, playing a bit of a Mario-Bros.-like jump-and-run with Pacman, for example) – but I had just no time for that. The games itself were all simple and small – but there were eight of them.</p>
<p>Which, by my current calculations, were at least seven games too many for a 48h-competition...</p>
<p><strong>Code Quality</strong> - let's not talk about that. This was hands-down the worst code I've ever written. I've written BASIC on my calculator that was better structured… I just didn't have time to stop and think. So, copy-and-paste it was, mostly. And brute force. And a lot of “what's the most stupid thing that could possibly work at least half of the time”.</p>
<p><strong>Pacman</strong> - I still don't know how the hell I managed to get completely stumped by writing pacman. I was on the wrong path, somehow and as a result I wasted much too much time even getting it to the sorry state it's in now. The ghosts just move randomly, the frame-rate is ridiculously low, it's buggy as hell. And it doesn't even look too much like pacman. Not good.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong> - The lucas-arts inspired point-and-click adventure level was first planned to be the <em>cool</em> level of the game. The one that would pay back for all the bugs in the other levels. Well, no, that didn't work out. I wrote half of an engine for it, but there just wasn't enough time – and I didn't really know how to actually write a point-and-click adventure game engine… So I started that level over – with about 4 hours left – and basically cut down all the features until it was just one big if-else tree. Not good, part 2.</p>
<p><strong>Time management</strong> - It's easy to lose track of just how much work is still to do when you're working on eight different games at the same time. And losing track I did.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> - Before I started, I thought that I generally knew how to program all the games I had planned. Well, yes, generally. But what are good jumping dynamics for a platformer? How should I do collision testing? How do I insert scaled sprites into a ray-casted world? By which rules do the monsters move in pacman? I have no idea. Oh, and no time to find out... Not good, part 3.</p>
<h2 id="what-ill-do-different-next-time">What I'll do different next time</h2>
<p>I'm going to write one game. Like, <em>one</em>.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>One! Eins! Uno!</p>
<p>One single, polished, working game that's fun to play.</p>
<p>Not freaking eight badly made ones...</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>
<p>Ludum Dare 24 was fun!</p>
