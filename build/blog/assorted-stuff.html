<p>Last week, I submitted a <a href="http://r-wos.org/hacks/gti">little hack</a> to reddit and it was quite well received. It still failed to
take down my cheap shared-hosting account, though...</p>
<p>The comments on reddit were pretty nice, but what really made me smile was Greg K-H <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111049168280159033135/posts/ELbqLDkDzJv">sharing it on Google+</a>. I &quot;followed&quot; Greg some time ago because - well, he maintains my kernel - and thus saw my 100 lines of C coming up on my stream. I liked that much more than I would usually admit. :-)</p>
<p>Today, as promised, I uploaded <a href="http://r-wos.org/hacks/render-brot">the renderer</a> that generated the picture from the last entry. I wanted to polish it a bit first, but it's 35 degrees outside (and inside) - much too warm for anything that involves thinking. So, it's hardly usable, but I'm pretty sure that the target group for mandelbrot images doesn't care too much.</p>
<p>It does have one neat feature, though - one can directly link to specific positions and zoom-settings. The image I've posted before, for example, is from about
<a href="http://r-wos.org/hacks/render-brot#-0.40227665787788197|-0.1338824451229402|0.009697737297875247">here</a>.</p>
<p>I've also registered for the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare 48h game programming competition</a> next weekend. It's my first programming competition of any sort - and it'll be my first finished game, if I succeed.</p>
<p>I've thought about writing in Racket for the contest - but I won't, since I would probably have been the only one using Racket, and since I'm not yet that good in it. I'll do a Racket-based Ludum Dare attendance once I can be pretty sure I won't be a disgrace to the language... ;-)</p>
<p>JavaScript and the 2D drawing context of the canvas element (some people call that combination &quot;HTML5&quot;) is what I'll be using this weekend.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a whole lotta fun, I'm sure.</p>
