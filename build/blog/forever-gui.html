      <h1>A Graphical Forever Project</h1>
      <p><b><time datetime="2013-02-13 00:00:00 &#43;0000">2013-02-13 00:00:00 &#43;0000</time></b></p>
      <p>A month ago, <a href="http://www.dev.gd/20130122-the-joys-of-having-a-forever-project.html">a nice little blog post</a>
made rounds on the internet. It describes the joys of having a Forever Project,
a project that can't be completed but that you also can't stop to think about.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I quite liked it. I used to think that I was just
not productive enough, not working hard enough on those kinds of projects.
The post promotes a quite different, more romantic view: How wonderful, all
those people working on crazy, ambitious, world-changing stuff!</p>
<p>However, the post says &quot;a&quot; forever project, as in &quot;one&quot; - and I have more than
one that would fit the description. So I still think I'm slacking too much.
The truth is probably somewhere in-between.</p>
<p>My current Forever Project (see? that doesn't sound right - you're supposed
to have only one) is a GUI, as in &quot;desktop environment&quot;. I don't have anything
to show, yet. But I thought I might just join in with all the programmers that
talked about their crazy/stupid Forever Projects and - well - talk about it.</p>
<p>Today, I'll start with a rough outline of my goals:</p>
<p>I'd like to do some things that are hard or impossible to do in current
desktop environments. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'd like to replace the SSL certificate-handling unit in my browser with one
that warns me when the certificate changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like vim (not &quot;something vaguely vim-like&quot;) in every text input field,
including the search box of my media player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like a proximity-based mouse cursor, with clicks always going to the
nearest button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like to take an HTML renderer and send the output through an edge-detection
filter and down-scale the resulting image. On a machine without a display.
Why? Well, why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd like to quickly hack one-off shell-scripts with a GUI. And combine them
to bigger programs, and into a bigger GUI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What that really means is that I want the convenience and flexibility that
unix provides for text-only programming - only that I want it for GUI programs.</p>
<p>That also means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything has to be completely language-agnostic. Not a framework, nor a
library. X11 is already like that, in a way - but it's too complicated
to use.</li>
<li>Everything should be dead-simple.  You should be able to
write shell one-liners for simple GUI programs, just as easy as working with
text(-files) is on unix today (and was 30 years ago, for that matter...).
Printing to a window should not be harder than <code>echo(1)</code>ing something to
a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's getting a bit late now, so let's open another forever project: write
a blog post about the forever project. ;-)</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> have a bit of code already &quot;done&quot;, and I think I have solutions to
some of the problems that come up. I'll be talking about that in the next
post. Which, I hope, will not be as abstract/boring as this one...</p>
<p>Happy Hacking Forever!</p>
