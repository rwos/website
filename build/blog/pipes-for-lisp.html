      <h1>Pipes for Lisp</h1>
      <p><b><time datetime="2011-07-07 00:00:00 &#43;0000">2011-07-07 00:00:00 &#43;0000</time></b></p>
      <p>I have already blogged about the <a title="Forwards, Backwards, orÂ nil" href="http://hackersdiary.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/forwards-backwards-or-nil/" target="_blank">reading order of programming languages</a>. Thinking about that, a stupid idea formed in my head:</p>
<p><em>What if Lisp had pipes?</em></p>
<p>You know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29" target="_blank">pipes, as in &quot;<code>|</code>&quot;</a>. These fabulous little things known from such nice expressions like &quot;<code>grep whatever * | more</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>cat stuff | sort | uniq</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, imagine how bad the last example would look, if the unix shell was lisp-like: <code>(uniq(sort(cat stuff)))</code>. (Well, maybe <em>bad</em> is the wrong word. Still, I think it looks considerably cleaner in shell-syntax.)</p>
<p>Now, if Lisp had my proposed, to-be-implemented, pipe-enabling, <del>world-changing</del>, preprocessor, it would look like this: <code>cat stuff | sort | uniq</code> - which is in fact identical to the shell version. Piping a command into another one would be the equivalent of using it (the first one) as the 2. command's parameter. Like so: <code>(define ls (list 1 2))</code> could become <code>list 1 2 | define ls</code>.</p>
<p>As you can see, that wouldn't change or break a lot - it would just give us programmers a way to more-or-less reverse the reading order of expressions. Which could come in handy in those case where Lisp's natural order reads awkwardly inverted.</p>
<p>In case you asking: I am fully aware of the fact that - with the examples given above - this looks neither helpful, nor lispy, nor even remotely like something anybody would want to have.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be back (with a prototype) to discuss this idea some more. Oh, hacking, you got me back...</p>
