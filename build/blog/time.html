<p>So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking.<br>
Racing around to come up behind you again.<br>
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older.<br>
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.<br>

<p>Today I learned: A full compile of <code>llvm</code> and <code>clang</code> takes about half an
hour on my machine. One 48th of a day. About one-eighth of my leisure
time.</p>
<p>I'd like to schedule a meeting with the inventor of that whole 40-hour
week thing. 8-8-8 is a neat idea, but only if you teleport yourself
to work the very moment your alarm clock rings - and back home again,
after exactly 480 minutes of working without a pause. Then, you'll have
exactly 28800 seconds for &quot;recreation&quot;, before you beat yourself to sleep
in a sub-second.</p>
<p>I don't think it works that way.</p>
