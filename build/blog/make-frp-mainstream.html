<p>I'm currently playing around with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">functional reactive programming</a>,
specifically Racket's <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/frtime/index.html">FrTime</a>
language/library.</p>
<p>I haven't done that much with it, yet - I've just thrown together some small
scripts, playing with the concept. But I can say this: if
you haven't programmed anything in a reactive style yet, drop everything
you're doing, get to your machine, and try it! It's fantastic!</p>
<p>You can say things like &quot;the position of this is the integral of its velocity
over time&quot;. Or &quot;the force vector is the vector from the object's position to
the mouse pointer scaled by $x&quot;. And that's it, you don't need to worry about
<em>doing</em> the updates - you just declare stuff and off it goes.</p>
<p>Well, I just realize that I'm pretty bad at explaining the magic. Maybe it can
only be seen in person. But it's really, really, <em>really</em> great! It feels
so high-level, and it plays so well with purely functional programming
and function composition and all that. I just don't understand why it isn't
more mainstream.</p>
<p>I mean, it <em>is</em> mainstream in the sense that the Observer OOP-pattern can be
used to do something quite like it - but you'd have
to build the primitives yourself, as the Observer pattern is much more low-level.
Go's goroutines and channels could also be used in a functional-reactive fashion,
I suppose. But the <em>real</em> magic only comes into play in systems like FrTime or
<a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, where there are first-class behaviors and events.</p>
<p>Functional reactive programming works great for interactive stuff like GUIs or
games - but it should be an improvement for basically everything that has
event-handlers, callbacks, or some kind of polling loop.</p>
<p>It's beyond me why it is so esoteric. It's much more useful, and
more fun, than OOP. Everybody should use it.</p>
