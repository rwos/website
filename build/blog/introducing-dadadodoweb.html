      <h1>Introducing DadaDodoWeb</h1>
      <p><b><time datetime="2011-09-11 00:00:00 &#43;0000">2011-09-11 00:00:00 &#43;0000</time></b></p>
      <p>Today in our series of funny quick hacks: DadaDodoWeb.</p>
<p>I just downloaded Jamie Zawinski's <a href="http://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/">dadadodo</a>. This is a markov chain implementation that works on text. It's pretty simple - and sometimes spits out surprisingly cool sentences. To quote jwz himself:</p>
<blockquote>DadaDodo is a program that analyses texts for word probabilities, and then generates random sentences based on that. Sometimes these sentences are nonsense; but sometimes they cut right through to the heart of the matter, and reveal hidden meanings.</blockquote>
Now, with some glue written in <del>COBOL</del> PHP, DadaDodoWeb does the following:
<p>It gets some random word off /usr/dict/words; googles it (using the &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; button); strips the html; feeds this into dadadodo; and twitters the result. It does some sanity checking along the way, but this is basically it.</p>
<p>I have it sitting in cron.hourly, so it should twit a new status every hour my machine is online. Which is most of the time.</p>
<p>It didn't spit out anything too cool yet, but still: So much fun for 15 minutes of hacking! Unbeatable.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/DadaDodoWeb">follow DadaDodoWeb</a>!</p>
<p>Update: I did some more fine-tuning. The script now twits with a more random interval and, additionally, randomly hash-tags some words. I don't know why I find this so entertaining. It's so stupid. Man, it's fun!</p>
<p>Update #2: And the second version is online. But now back to serious things...</p>
