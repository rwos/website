<p>A <a href="http://killbodyeatsoul.net/stuff">colleague</a> of mine recently introduced me to the language/framework called <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>.</p>
<p>It's a Java-based visualization language. It's meant to be a quick tool, targeting artists - and not necessarily programmers. So it's pretty simple to use. But the coolest thing about it is this:</p>
<p>It actually works.</p>
<p>I don't think that Processing is my new favourite programming language, but still - it's a whole lot of fun. This is what I came up with, after about 2 hours playing around:</p>
<p><a href="http://r-wos.org/processing/index.html">The Canvas Game Of Life</a> (a pretty silly &quot;living&quot; drawing applet)</p>
<p>So, I'm impressed: Something built with Java does actually work. Like, even on Linux and all that. Okay, the IDE sucks, but for 100 or so lines of code, I can live with it.</p>
<p>Recreational Programming FTW!</p>
