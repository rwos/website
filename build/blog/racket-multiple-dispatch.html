<p>Some months ago, Racket 5.3 introduced a new
<a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/struct-generics.html">generics library</a>.
As you would expect, it's basically a convenient way to implement generic
interfaces for related type-specific operations
(<a href="http://blog.racket-lang.org/2012/11/generics.html">for example</a>
generic queue operations for different queue implementations).</p>
<p>That's all fine and works well, but it doesn't (as of now) support
dispatching for more than one function parameter, i.e.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch">multiple dispatch</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is a reasonably easy way one can get something equivalent to
multiple dispatch in Racket: pattern matching. (This may seem obvious
to others but it wasn't obvious to me until very recently.)</p>
<p>To take the example from the wikipedia page - in Common Lisp one
could do:</p>
<pre><code>(defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y asteroid))
  ;; deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
  )
(defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y spaceship))
  ;; deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
  )
(defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y asteroid))
  ;; deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
  )
(defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y spaceship))
  ;; deal with spaceship hitting spaceship
  )
</code></pre>
<p>While in Racket one could use <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/match.html">pattern matching</a>
to get the same effect:</p>
<pre><code>(define/match (collide-with x y)
  ((asteroid asteroid)
    #| deal with asteroid hitting asteroid |#)
  ((asteroid spaceship)
    #| deal with asteroid hitting spaceship |#)
  ((spaceship asteroid)
    #| deal with spaceship hitting asteroid |#)
  ((spaceship spaceship)
    #| deal with spaceship hitting spaceship |#))
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know enough Common Lisp or Racket to say whether these two versions
are <em>completely</em> equivalent (especially performance-wise), but they can
both be used in the same way - which is good enough for me.</p>
