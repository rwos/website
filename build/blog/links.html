<p>Just some links I stumbled upon recently:</p>
<p>The first one's an interview with Ken Arnold, and also the best discussion
about program design and OOP I've ever read. It's actually the only discussion
of OOP I know of that doesn't revolve around solutions for self-inflicted
problems.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a page with the whole text, so here's

<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/tasteP.html">part 2</a>,
<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/distribP.html">part 3</a>,
<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/swayP.html">part 4</a>,
<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/decoupleP.html">part 5</a>,
and <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/issuesP.html">part 6</a>.</p>

<p>The NSA recently declassified their internal magazine &quot;Cryptologs&quot;. Quite a lot
of the content is still blacked-out, though. Also, this is pretty much the
worst magazine I've ever read. The whole thing looks extremely amateur.
Still, quite interesting, I think.</p>
<p>The PDFs are available on <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/cryptologs.shtml">the NSA website</a>
and there's also a <a href="http://cryptome.org/2013/03/cryptologs/nsa-cryptologs-contents-01.htm">Cryptome mirror</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, here's a short and simple tutorial for <a href="http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/simulate-fabric-and-ragdolls-with-simple-verlet-integration/">cloth and ragdoll simulations
using verlet integration</a>.</p>
<p>Not very useful if you're not currently working on a game - but what kind of programmer
isn't always working on some kind of a game? There, you see, useful for everyone.</p>
