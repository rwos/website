<p>Hey! News from the time wasting department: This blog is now available
under a new URL: <a href="http://r-wos.org/blog/">http://r-wos.org/blog/</a>.
The old links <em>should</em> get a 301 redirect here, though. Hope that works for
everybody. Don't ask how the redirect is implemented - trust me, you don't want
to know.</p>
<p>Also, the blog's now generated by an ugly little Racket program (it was
formally generated by an ugly little Python program).  Well, actually, Racket
doesn't have a Markdown parser yet, so that part's still done with Python.
Don't ask. You <em>really</em> don't want to know.</p>
<p>I hope the RSS readers can cope with a 301 redirect.  I hope the RSS is still
working. I hope I can move the Disqus comments. I hope I can fix the encoding
errors.</p>
<p>And I hope I remember why I did this again.</p>
