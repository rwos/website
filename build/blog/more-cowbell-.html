<p>These guys are crazy.</p>
<p>I just watched <a href="http://blip.tv/goto-video/50-in-50-by-richard-p-gabriel-and-guy-l-steele-1479808">the great 2008 JAOO talk by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>. Well, it's less a talk and more a programming language rock concert. Or something like that.</p>
<p>It features a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_%28programming_language%29">Shakespeare</a> play calculating powers of two, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_%28programming_language%29">pictures</a> printing &quot;hello world&quot;, XKCD comics, an APL Song by Richard M. Stallman and numerous other gems.</p>
<p>My favourite moment was Steele crying &quot;more Cowbell!&quot; with a Perl program scrolling by in the background.</p>

<p>It's geek humour, I guess...</p>
